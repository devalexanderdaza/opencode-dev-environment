## 1.0.2.x Series

### [**1.0.2.5**] - 2026-01-02

Security and documentation release fixing hardcoded API key exposure in `.utcp_config.json` and broken install script configuration. Adds comprehensive documentation for Narsil's three neural embedding backends (Voyage AI, OpenAI, Local ONNX) and HTTP server visualization setup.

#### Security
- **CWE-798 (Hardcoded Credentials)**: Fixed hardcoded `VOYAGE_API_KEY` in `.utcp_config.json` - now uses `${VOYAGE_API_KEY}` variable reference loaded from `.env`

#### Fixed
- `install-narsil.sh` generating invalid config with `_note`, `_neural_backends` fields that break Code Mode parsing
- Missing `--watch` flag in all recommended Narsil configurations

#### Added
- Neural backend comparison table showing all 3 options: Voyage AI (recommended) · OpenAI · Local ONNX
- Separate configuration examples for each neural backend in install guide
- HTTP server stdin pipe trick documentation (`tail -f /dev/null |` to prevent EOF shutdown)
- Symbol/Hybrid view parameter requirements (`root`, `repo`) in visualization docs

#### Changed
- All Narsil config examples now include `--watch` flag for auto-reindexing
- API key references changed from hardcoded values to `${VOYAGE_API_KEY}` variable syntax
- Install script help text expanded with Neural Search Backends section

### [**1.0.2.4**] - 2026-01-01

Major infrastructure release with critical bug fixes, security hardening, MCP install automation, and comprehensive codebase standardization across 70+ files. Adds sub-agent delegation for token efficiency and universal stack-agnostic debugging.

#### Fixed
- **Critical**: SQLite transaction nesting error in `memory_index_scan` - `indexMemory()` now uses composable `database.transaction()` wrapper
- **Critical**: Race condition where database changes weren't visible across MCP/script connections - added file-based notification with `reinitializeDatabase()`
- **Critical**: Failed vector insertions leaving orphaned metadata - explicit transaction control with rollback
- **High**: Schema created with wrong embedding dimensions before provider warmup - `getConfirmedEmbeddingDimension()` with polling
- **High**: Constitutional cache didn't invalidate on external database edits - mtime tracking added
- **High**: Rate limiting state lost on server restart - persistent `config` table in SQLite
- **High**: Stale prepared statements after database reset - `clearPreparedStatements()` in reset paths
- Query validation for whitespace-only/empty/null inputs
- UTF-8 BOM (EF BB BF) detection in memory parser
- Cache key collision risk - SHA256 hash-based keys
- Non-interactive mode silently using defaults - now fails with guidance
- Orphaned vectors never auto-cleaned - `verifyIntegrity({ autoClean: true })`

#### Security
- **CWE-22**: Path traversal protection in CLI `CONFIG.DATA_FILE` and DB-stored paths
- **CWE-400**: Input length limits for MCP tool parameters (query 10K, title 500, paths 500 chars)
- MEDIUM severity issues reduced from 4 to 1

#### Added
- **MCP Install Scripts Suite**: Shell-based installers for all 6 MCP servers with shared utilities library (33 functions)
- **Sub-agent delegation**: `/spec_kit:handover` and `/memory:save` now delegate heavy work to sub-agents for token efficiency
- **Session behavior modes**: `--brief`, `--verbose`, `--debug` flags for controlling response verbosity
- **Universal debugging methodology**: Stack-agnostic 4-phase approach (Observe → Analyze → Hypothesize → Fix) with new reference doc
- **Auto/Confirm modes**: 6 `/create` commands now support `:auto` and `:confirm` mode flags
- **Optional research chaining**: `/spec_kit:complete` supports `:with-research` and `:auto-debug` flags
- Configurable scoring weights for smart ranking (`smartRanking.recencyWeight`)
- Configurable trigger phrase limit via `maxTriggersPerMemory`
- Plain-language gates (~50+ "STOP HERE - Wait for X" markers) in 16 command files
- "What Next?" navigation tables in 14 commands
- Confidence checkpoints in 9 YAML workflow files

#### Changed
- **References reorganized**: 18 files moved from flat structure into 7 logical sub-folders (`config/`, `debugging/`, `memory/`, `structure/`, `templates/`, `validation/`, `workflows/`)
- **79 internal links fixed** across reference documentation
- **Lib consolidation**: Shared modules centralized in `lib/` folder with re-export wrappers
- **Asset template alignment**: 9 asset files standardized across 6 skill folders
- **workflows-code skill**: Priority-based resource loading (P1/P2/P3), references reorganized into 5 sub-folders
- **Code style alignment**: 70 files standardized with snake_case naming, 3-line box-drawing headers, ~3,900 lines metadata removed
- `/spec_kit:debug` made stack-agnostic - removed frontend-specific tool references

Security patch fixing HIGH severity DoS vulnerability in `qs` dependency. Documentation updated with complete MCP tool reference for resume command.

#### Security
- **HIGH (CVE-2025-15284)**: Fixed DoS vulnerability in `qs` query string parser (6.14.0 → 6.14.1) - `arrayLimit` bypass via bracket notation allowed memory exhaustion. Transitive through `express@5.2.1`.

### [**1.0.2.1**] - 2025-12-31

Comprehensive system hardening release with critical bug fixes, security improvements, and performance optimizations for the Spec Kit Memory system.

- All hardcoded paths now use environment variables for portability
- Deprecated JS validators removed (bash validators preferred)
- Template metadata formats standardized

#### Security
- **CWE-22**: Added path validation to CLI `CONFIG.DATA_FILE`
