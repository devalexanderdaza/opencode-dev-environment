## Example: Feature PR

```markdown
## Summary

- Implements OAuth2 authentication flow with JWT tokens
- Adds login/logout endpoints
- Includes user session management

## Motivation

Replaces basic authentication to improve security and enable
SSO integration. Current basic auth is vulnerable to brute-force
attacks and doesn't support modern authentication patterns.

## Test Plan

### Manual Testing
- [x] Users can log in with email/password
- [x] Invalid credentials show appropriate error
- [x] JWT token persists across page refreshes
- [x] Logout clears session properly
- [x] Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### Automated Testing
- [x] 152 unit tests pass
- [x] 23 integration tests pass
- [x] Authentication flow tests added
- [x] No console errors

## Screenshots

![Login screen](./screenshots/login.png)
![Dashboard after login](./screenshots/dashboard.png)

## Security Considerations

- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Refresh tokens implemented with rotation
- CSRF protection enabled
- Rate limiting on login endpoint

## Related Issues

Closes #234
Related to #235 (SSO integration - follow-up)

## Deployment Notes

- Requires `JWT_SECRET` environment variable
- Database migration needed for user_sessions table
```

---

## Example: Bug Fix PR

```markdown
## Summary

- Fixes memory leak in data processing pipeline
- Adds proper cleanup for event listeners
- Implements connection pooling limits

## Problem

Large datasets were causing memory usage to grow unbounded.
Application would crash after processing ~10k records due to
unclosed database connections and lingering event listeners.

## Solution

- Implemented connection pooling with max 20 concurrent connections
- Added cleanup in `finally` blocks to ensure resources are released
- Removed event listeners after processing complete

## Test Plan

### Manual Testing
- [x] Processed 50k records without memory growth
- [x] Monitored memory usage with Chrome DevTools
- [x] Verified connections are properly closed

### Automated Testing
- [x] All existing tests pass
- [x] Added memory leak regression test
- [x] Load testing with 100k records passes

## Before/After

**Before**: Memory grows to 2GB after 10k records
**After**: Memory stable at 150MB for 50k+ records

## Related Issues

Fixes #345
Fixes #346 (duplicate of same issue)
```

---

## Example: Refactoring PR

```markdown
## Summary

- Extracts validation logic to reusable middleware
- Consolidates duplicate code across 5 route handlers
- Improves testability and maintainability

## Motivation

Validation logic was duplicated across multiple route handlers,
making it hard to maintain and test. Each endpoint had slightly
different validation patterns, leading to inconsistencies.

## Changes

- Created `ValidationMiddleware` class
- Migrated 5 route handlers to use middleware
- Removed 200+ lines of duplicate code
- Added comprehensive middleware tests

## Test Plan

### Functional Testing
- [x] All API endpoints still validate correctly
- [x] Error messages unchanged (backward compatible)
- [x] Edge cases still handled properly

### Automated Testing
- [x] All 147 existing tests pass
- [x] 32 new middleware tests added
- [x] Code coverage increased from 78% to 85%

## Non-Functional Improvements

- **Maintainability**: Validation logic now in one place
- **Testability**: Middleware can be tested independently
- **Consistency**: All endpoints use same validation pattern
- **Performance**: No degradation (benchmarked)

## Related Issues

Closes #123

## Migration Guide

No external API changes. Internal developers should use
`ValidationMiddleware.validate()` for new endpoints.
```

---

## PR Title Guidelines

**Format**: Follow Conventional Commits

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

**Examples**:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication system
fix(api): resolve memory leak in data processing
refactor(validation): extract validation to middleware
docs: update API reference with authentication guide
chore(deps): update axios to v1.6.0
```

---

## Summary Section Guidelines

**DO**:
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Keep each point concise (one line)
- Focus on **what** changed
- List 2-5 key changes

**DON'T**:
- Write paragraphs in summary
- Include implementation details
- List every file changed
- Be vague ("updated stuff")

**Example - Good**:
```markdown
## Summary

- Implements real-time notifications using WebSocket
- Adds notification badge with unread count
- Includes mark-as-read functionality
```

**Example - Bad**:
```markdown
## Summary

Updated the notification system. Made some changes to the
backend and frontend. Added WebSocket stuff.
```

### GitHub MCP (via Code Mode)

Alternative when `gh` CLI is unavailable or you need richer API features:

```javascript
call_tool_chain(`github.github_create_pull_request({
  owner: 'owner',
  repo: 'repo',
  title: 'feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication',
  head: 'feature/oauth',
  base: 'main',
  body: '## Summary\\n- Implements OAuth2 flow\\n\\n## Test Plan\\n- [x] Tests pass\\n\\nCloses #234'
})`)
```

**Note**: GitHub MCP runs via `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`. Requires a GitHub PAT configured in `.utcp_config.json`. See [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) Section 2 for full tool reference.

## Tips

1. **Write PR description as you code** - Don't wait until end
2. **Test plan first** - Know what you're testing before claiming "done"
3. **Screenshots save review time** - Visual evidence is powerful
4. **Link issues early** - Connect PR to work tracking immediately
5. **Self-review first** - Review your own PR before requesting review
6. **Keep it focused** - One PR = one logical change
7. **Update as you go** - Mark test plan items as you complete them
