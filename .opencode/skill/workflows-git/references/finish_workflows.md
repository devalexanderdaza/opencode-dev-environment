# Git Finish - Detailed Workflow Reference

Complete workflow documentation for completing development work with structured integration options.

---

## 1. 📖 OVERVIEW

Systematically complete development work by verifying tests, presenting integration options, and executing the chosen workflow. Ensures work is properly integrated with clean branch management.

**Core principle**: Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up = reliable completion workflow

---

## 2. 🛠️ PROCESS OVERVIEW

1. Verify all tests pass (blocking gate)
2. Determine base branch for integration
3. Present 4 structured options (merge, PR, keep, discard)
4. Execute chosen workflow safely
5. Clean up worktree if appropriate

**Key Principles**:
- **Test gate**: Never proceed with failing tests
- **Structured choices**: Always present same 4 options
- **Safe execution**: Verify before destructive operations
- **Clean state**: Remove worktrees and temp branches appropriately
- **Confirmation required**: Never delete work without explicit approval

---

## 3. ✅ COMPLETE WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Purpose**: Ensure code quality before integration

**Actions**:

1. **Detect test command**:
```bash
# Auto-detect based on project type
if [ -f package.json ]; then npm test; fi     # Node.js
if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then cargo test; fi     # Rust
if [ -f pytest.ini ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then pytest; fi  # Python
if [ -f go.mod ]; then go test ./...; fi      # Go
```

2. **Run tests**:
```bash
# Execute appropriate test suite
<detected-test-command>
```

3. **Evaluate results**:
   - **All pass**: Continue to Step 2
   - **Any fail**: STOP and report

**If tests fail**:
```text
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failure details]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

**Do not proceed to Step 2 with failing tests.**

**Validation**: `tests_verified`


### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

**Purpose**: Identify target branch for integration

**Actions**:

1. **Auto-detect base branch**:
```bash
# Try common base branches
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null && echo "main" || \
git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null && echo "master" || \
git merge-base HEAD develop 2>/dev/null && echo "develop"
```

2. **Confirm with user** (if ambiguous):
```text
Detected base branch: <branch-name>

Is this correct? (y/n)
```

3. **Store base branch** for later steps

**Validation**: `base_branch_determined`


### Step 3: Present Options

**Purpose**: Give user structured choices for integration

**Present exactly these 4 options (no modifications)**:

```text
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option? (1-4)
```

**Important**:
- Do NOT add explanations or descriptions
- Keep options concise and clear
- Wait for explicit user choice (1, 2, 3, or 4)
- Do NOT proceed without user input

**Validation**: `options_presented`


### Step 4: Execute Choice

**Purpose**: Safely execute the chosen integration workflow

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

**Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Switch to base branch
git checkout <base-branch>

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull

# 3. Merge feature branch
git merge <feature-branch>

# 4. Verify tests on merged result
<test-command>

# 5. If tests pass, delete feature branch
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  git branch -d <feature-branch>
else
  echo "Tests failed after merge. Fix before proceeding."
fi
```

**Note**: Post-merge test run is a safety verification only. The Step 1 test gate ensures the feature branch is already tested, so merge should be safe. This catches integration issues only (e.g., conflicts with recent main changes).

**Then**: Proceed to Step 5 (Cleanup Worktree)

**Validation**: `merge_complete`


#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

**Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Push branch to remote
git push -u origin <feature-branch>

# 2. Create PR using GitHub CLI (preferred)
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullet points of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
- [ ] All tests pass

## Related Issues
Closes #<issue-number> (if applicable)
EOF
)"
```

**Alternative: GitHub MCP (via Code Mode)**

If `gh` CLI is unavailable or you need richer PR features, use GitHub MCP:

```javascript
// Create PR via GitHub MCP
call_tool_chain(`github.github_create_pull_request({
  owner: '<repo-owner>',
  repo: '<repo-name>',
  title: 'feat(scope): description',
  head: '<feature-branch>',
  base: '<base-branch>',
  body: '## Summary\\n- Change 1\\n- Change 2\\n\\n## Test Plan\\n- [ ] Tests pass'
})`)
```

**Note**: GitHub MCP runs via `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`. Requires a GitHub Personal Access Token configured in `.utcp_config.json`. See SKILL.md Section 2 for full tool list and usage.

**PR Title Guidelines**:
- Use conventional commit format: `feat: `, `fix: `, `refactor: `
- Be specific and descriptive
- Example: `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support`

**Ask user about worktree**:
```text
Keep worktree for PR updates? (y/n)
- y: Preserve worktree (you can make changes for review feedback)
- n: Remove worktree (switch to other work immediately)
```

**If user chooses 'n'**: Proceed to Step 5 (Cleanup Worktree)
**If user chooses 'y'**: Skip Step 5, report worktree location

**Validation**: `pr_created`


#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Report status
echo "Keeping branch <feature-branch>. Worktree preserved at <path>."
```

**Important**: Do NOT cleanup worktree for this option

**Validation**: `branch_preserved`


#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first (REQUIRED)**:
```text
⚠️  WARNING: This will permanently delete:
- Branch: <feature-branch>
- All commits:
  <commit-hash-1> <commit-message-1>
  <commit-hash-2> <commit-message-2>
  ...
- Worktree at: <path>

This action CANNOT be undone.

Type 'discard' to confirm (or anything else to cancel):
```

**Wait for exact confirmation**. If user types anything other than "discard", cancel operation.

**If confirmed**:
```bash
# 1. Switch to base branch
git checkout <base-branch>

# 2. Force delete feature branch
git branch -D <feature-branch>

# 3. Report completion
echo "Branch <feature-branch> discarded."
```

**Then**: Proceed to Step 5 (Cleanup Worktree)

**Validation**: `branch_discarded`


### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree

**Purpose**: Remove worktree directories when appropriate

**Cleanup Rules**:
- **Option 1 (Merge)**: Cleanup worktree ✓
- **Option 2 (PR)**: Ask user (may need for PR updates)
- **Option 3 (Keep)**: Do NOT cleanup ✗
- **Option 4 (Discard)**: Cleanup worktree ✓

**Actions** (for Options 1, 4, and Option 2 if user chose 'n'):

1. **Check if in worktree**:
```bash
# Get current branch (empty if detached HEAD)
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)

if [ -z "$current_branch" ]; then
  # Detached HEAD - find worktree by path
  worktree_path=$(git worktree list | grep "$(pwd)" | awk '{print $1}')
else
  # Normal branch - find worktree by branch name
  worktree_path=$(git worktree list | grep "$current_branch" | awk '{print $1}')
fi
```

2. **If worktree exists**:
```bash
# Remove worktree
if [ -n "$worktree_path" ] && [ "$worktree_path" != "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" ]; then
  git worktree remove "$worktree_path"
  echo "Cleaned up worktree at $worktree_path"
else
  echo "Not in a worktree (in main repository)"
fi
```

3. **If not in worktree**:
```bash
echo "No worktree cleanup needed."
```

**Validation**: `worktree_cleaned`

## 4. ⚖️ DECISION MATRIX

| Scenario | Recommended Option | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Solo project, simple change | Option 1 (Merge locally) | Fast, no review needed |
| Team project, needs review | Option 2 (Create PR) | Enables code review, CI checks; keep worktree for updates |
| Work in progress, need to switch contexts | Option 3 (Keep as-is) | Preserve work for later |
| Experimental code, failed approach | Option 4 (Discard) | Clean up failed experiments |
| Temp branch (main-focused workflow) | Option 1 (Merge locally) | Aligns with git-worktrees main_temp strategy |
| Feature branch (long-running) | Option 2 (Create PR) | Aligns with git-worktrees feature_branch strategy |
| Hotfix for production | Option 1 or 2 (Merge/PR) | Never discard or keep hotfixes |
| Spike/research | Option 4 (Discard) | Research doesn't need to be merged |

---

## 5. ❌ COMMON MISTAKES

**Skipping test verification**:
- **Problem**: Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix**: Always run tests in Step 1 before offering options
- **Detection**: If user says "skip tests" → refuse and explain risk

**Open-ended questions instead of structured options**:
- **Problem**: "What should I do next?" → ambiguous, confusing
- **Fix**: Always present exactly the same 4 options in Step 3
- **Detection**: If tempted to ask "what next?" → use structured options

**Automatic worktree cleanup for Option 3 (Keep)**:
- **Problem**: Remove worktree when user explicitly chose to keep it
- **Fix**: Skip cleanup for Option 3; for Option 2, ask user preference
- **Detection**: Check option number before cleanup in Step 5

**No confirmation for discard (Option 4)**:
- **Problem**: Accidentally delete work permanently
- **Fix**: Require typed "discard" confirmation with clear warning
- **Detection**: Option 4 selected → show warning and wait for exact match

**Merge without pulling latest base branch**:
- **Problem**: Merge conflicts or outdated base
- **Fix**: Always `git pull` base branch before merging (Step 4, Option 1)
- **Detection**: Before merge → check if base is up to date

**Skip tests after merge**:
- **Problem**: Merged code breaks tests even though feature tests passed
- **Fix**: Run tests again after merge in Option 1
- **Detection**: After merge → verify test command runs again

## 7. 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Tests Fail Before Options

**Symptom**: Test suite has failures in Step 1

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose
cargo test -- --nocapture
pytest -v
go test -v ./...
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Fix tests first**: Address failures before proceeding
2. **Check test environment**: Ensure dependencies installed
3. **Verify test command**: Confirm correct test command for project
4. **Ask user**: "Tests failing. Options: (A) Fix now (B) Show me failures (C) Skip (not recommended)"

**Never proceed to Step 3 with failing tests unless user explicitly overrides**


### Cannot Determine Base Branch

**Symptom**: Auto-detection fails, multiple candidates

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Check current branch's upstream
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD@{upstream}

# Check merge-base with common branches
git merge-base HEAD main
git merge-base HEAD master
git merge-base HEAD develop
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Ask user explicitly**: "Cannot determine base branch. Which branch should I merge into? (main/master/develop/other)"
2. **Check AGENTS.md**: Look for project-specific branch conventions
3. **Default to main**: If project uses main as primary branch


### PR Creation Fails (Option 2)

**Symptom**: `gh pr create` command fails

**Common Causes**:
- `gh` CLI not installed
- Not authenticated with GitHub
- No upstream remote configured
- Branch already has open PR

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check gh CLI installation
gh --version

# Check authentication
gh auth status

# Check remote configuration
git remote -v

# Check existing PRs
gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current)
```

**Solutions**:

**Not installed**:
```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux
sudo apt install gh

# Windows
choco install gh
```

**Not authenticated**:
```bash
gh auth login
# Follow interactive prompts
```

**No upstream remote**:
```bash
# Add remote
git remote add origin <repository-url>

# Verify
git remote -v
```

**PR already exists**:
```bash
# List existing PRs
gh pr list

# Ask user: "PR already exists for this branch. Options: (A) Update existing (B) Cancel (C) Create draft PR"
```


### Merge Conflicts (Option 1)

**Symptom**: Merge fails with conflicts

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check conflict status
git status

# Show conflicts
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Report conflicts**:
```text
Merge conflicts detected in:
- src/file1.js
- src/file2.py

Would you like to:
A) Resolve conflicts now
B) Abort merge and use Option 2 (PR) instead
C) Abort merge and keep branch (Option 3)
```

2. **Resolve conflicts** (if user chooses A):
```bash
# Show conflict details
git diff <file>

# After user resolves
git add <resolved-files>
git commit

# Verify tests
<test-command>
```


### Worktree Removal Fails

**Symptom**: `git worktree remove` fails

**Common Causes**:
- Worktree has uncommitted changes
- Worktree is locked
- Worktree directory doesn't exist

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Check worktree status
cd <worktree-path> && git status

# Check if locked
git worktree list | grep locked
```

**Solutions**:

**Uncommitted changes**:
```bash
# Stash changes
cd <worktree-path> && git stash

# Or commit them
git add . && git commit -m "Save work before cleanup"

# Then remove
git worktree remove <path>
```

**Locked worktree**:
```bash
# Unlock
git worktree unlock <path>

# Then remove
git worktree remove <path>
```

**Directory missing**:
```bash
# Prune stale worktree references
git worktree prune

# Verify clean state
git worktree list
```


### User Cancels Discard (Option 4)

**Symptom**: User types something other than "discard"

**Expected Behavior**:
```text
User typed: "cancel" (not "discard")

✓ Discard cancelled. Branch preserved.

What would you like to do instead?
1. Merge back to main locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option? (1-3)
```

**Re-present options 1-3** (exclude Option 4 since user just cancelled it)
