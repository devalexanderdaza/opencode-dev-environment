# Implementation Summary

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: impl-summary-core + level2-verify + level3-arch | v2.0 -->

<!-- WHEN TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:
Level 3 Summary (+Arch) is appropriate when:
- Architecture decisions were made (decision-record.md)
- Milestone completion tracking needed
- ADR outcome documentation required
- Risk mitigation results to record

DO NOT use Level 3 Summary if:
- Simple feature <100 LOC (use Level 1)
- Only verification needed (use Level 2)
- Governance approval workflow required (use Level 3+)
