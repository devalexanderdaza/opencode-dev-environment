## TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS

**How to use this template:**
1. Fill in all `[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: ...]` placeholders with actual values
2. Complete this template AFTER implementation is finished
3. Document all files created, modified, or deleted
4. Record key decisions and their rationale
5. Include verification results (tests, browser checks)
6. Remove placeholder text after filling in content

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Creating before implementation is complete
- Omitting key decisions or rationale
- Skipping verification/testing documentation
- Not documenting known limitations or tech debt

**Related templates:**
- Required for ALL levels (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3)
- Reference spec.md for original requirements
- Reference plan.md for architectural decisions
- Update checklist.md with final verification status
