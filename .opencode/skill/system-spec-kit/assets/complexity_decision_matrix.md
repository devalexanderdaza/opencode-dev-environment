# Complexity Decision Matrix - Quick Reference for Level Selection

Quick reference for complexity-based level selection and feature enabling.

## 1. 📖 OVERVIEW

### Purpose

This matrix provides quick-reference guidance for selecting the appropriate documentation level based on task complexity. Use it to determine which templates to use and which features to enable.

### Usage

1. Estimate your task's complexity score using the dimension signals in Section 3
2. Match the score to a level in Section 2
3. Verify feature requirements in Section 4
4. Use the CLI commands in Section 8 to create your spec folder

## 2. 📊 LEVEL SELECTION BY SCORE

| Score Range | Level | Name         | Templates                                    | Features Auto-Enabled |
|-------------|-------|--------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 0-25        | 1     | Baseline     | spec, plan, tasks, impl-summary              | None                 |
| 26-55       | 2     | Verification | Level 1 + checklist                          | dep-graph (table)    |
| 56-79       | 3     | Full         | Level 2 + decision-record                    | dep-graph (ASCII), effort-est |
| 80-100      | 3+    | Extended     | Level 3 + AI protocols + extended checklist  | All features         |

## 6. 🧭 QUICK DECISION GUIDE

### When to Override Auto-Detection

**Override to HIGHER level when:**
- Security-sensitive changes (even if low complexity score)
- Breaking API changes
- Database migrations
- Multi-team coordination required
- Compliance/audit requirements

**Override to LOWER level when:**
- False positive on keywords ("research" used casually)
- Simple task described with complex language
- One-time utility script

### Confidence Thresholds

| Confidence | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 85-95% | Trust recommendation |
| 70-84% | Review dimensions, may accept |
| 50-69% | Review carefully, consider override |
| <50% | Manual selection recommended |

### Boundary Cases

| Score | Near Boundary? | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 23-27 | L1/L2 boundary | If any risk factors, choose L2 |
| 53-57 | L2/L3 boundary | If architectural impact, choose L3 |
| 77-82 | L3/L3+ boundary | If multi-agent or AI protocols needed, choose L3+ |

## 7. 💡 EXAMPLE CLASSIFICATIONS

| Task Description | Score | Level | Key Factors |
|------------------|-------|-------|-------------|
| "Fix typo in README" | 8 | 1 | Low scope, no risk |
| "Add email validation to form" | 22 | 1 | Single file, clear scope |
| "Create reusable modal component" | 38 | 2 | Multiple files, needs testing |
| "Implement OAuth2 authentication" | 62 | 3 | Auth risk, multiple systems |
| "Add payment processing with Stripe" | 71 | 3 | High risk, external integration |
| "Platform migration with 10 workstreams" | 89 | 3+ | Multi-agent, high coordination |
| "Real-time collaboration feature" | 85 | 3+ | Complex state, high coordination |

## 8. ⌨️ CLI QUICK REFERENCE

```bash
# Create spec folder with Level 1 (default)
./scripts/create-spec-folder.sh "Simple bugfix"

# Create spec folder with Level 2
./scripts/create-spec-folder.sh "Add authentication" --level 2

# Create spec folder with Level 3
./scripts/create-spec-folder.sh "Major refactor" --level 3

# Create spec folder with Level 3+ (extended)
./scripts/create-spec-folder.sh "Platform migration" --level 3+
```

> **Note:** The `--complexity` flag and `detect-complexity.js` have been deprecated. Use `--level N` to select the appropriate level based on the guidelines above.
