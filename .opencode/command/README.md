## Command File Structure

Each command is defined in a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: command-name
description: Brief description of what the command does
allowed-tools: [Tool1, Tool2, Tool3]
---
```

### Asset Files

Commands may have associated YAML asset files in `assets/` subdirectories containing:
- Workflow definitions
- Preset configurations
- Step-by-step instructions

---

## Usage

Commands are invoked using the slash notation:

```
/namespace:command [arguments]
```

Examples:
```
/spec_kit:complete "Add user authentication"
/memory:search "authentication patterns"
/create:skill --name "my-skill"
```

---

## Adding New Commands

1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate namespace directory
2. Add YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`
3. Document the command's purpose, usage, and workflow
4. If needed, create asset files in `assets/` subdirectory

See `workflows-documentation` skill for command template and creation guidelines.
