# 🚨 MANDATORY PHASE - BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT

**This phase MUST be passed before workflow execution. You CANNOT proceed until phase shows ✅ PASSED.**

---

## 🔒 PHASE 1: SUBCOMMAND PARSING

**STATUS: ☐ BLOCKED**

```
EXECUTE THIS CHECK FIRST:

├─ IF $ARGUMENTS starts with "create":
│   ├─ Extract checkpoint name from remaining args
│   ├─ IF name provided:
│   │   ├─ Validate name (alphanumeric + dashes, no spaces, max 50 chars)
│   │   ├─ Store as: subcommand = "create", checkpoint_name = "<name>"
│   │   └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED → Route to CREATE workflow
│   └─ IF name missing:
│       ├─ ASK user: "What name for this checkpoint?"
│       ├─ WAIT for response
│       ├─ Validate and store
│       └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED
│
├─ IF $ARGUMENTS starts with "restore":
│   ├─ Extract checkpoint name from remaining args
│   ├─ IF name provided:
│   │   ├─ Store as: subcommand = "restore", checkpoint_name = "<name>"
│   │   └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED → Route to RESTORE workflow
│   └─ IF name missing:
│       ├─ List available checkpoints
│       ├─ ASK user to select
│       ├─ WAIT for response
│       └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED
│
├─ IF $ARGUMENTS starts with "list":
│   ├─ Store as: subcommand = "list"
│   └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED → Route to LIST workflow
│
├─ IF $ARGUMENTS starts with "delete":
│   ├─ Extract checkpoint name
│   ├─ IF name provided:
│   │   ├─ Store as: subcommand = "delete", checkpoint_name = "<name>"
│   │   └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED → Route to DELETE workflow
│   └─ IF name missing:
│       ├─ List available checkpoints
│       ├─ ASK user to select
│       └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED
│
└─ IF $ARGUMENTS is empty or invalid:
    ├─ Show usage help with subcommand options
    └─ SET STATUS: ⛔ BLOCKED (awaiting valid subcommand)

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user to provide valid subcommand and checkpoint name before continuing.

⛔ HARD STOP: DO NOT proceed until STATUS = ✅ PASSED
```

**Phase 1 Output:** `subcommand = ______` | `checkpoint_name = ______`

---

## ✅ PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION (BLOCKING)

**Before continuing to the workflow, verify phase status:**

| PHASE               | REQUIRED STATUS | YOUR STATUS | OUTPUT VALUE                      |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| PHASE 1: SUBCOMMAND | ✅ PASSED        | ______      | subcommand: ______ / name: ______ |

```
VERIFICATION CHECK:
├─ Phase shows ✅ PASSED?
│   ├─ YES → Proceed to corresponding subcommand section
│   └─ NO  → STOP and complete the blocked phase
```

---

## ⚠️ VIOLATION SELF-DETECTION (BLOCKING)

**YOU ARE IN VIOLATION IF YOU:**

- Started executing a subcommand before phase passed
- Assumed a checkpoint name without validation
- Skipped the name validation for create/delete/restore
- Did not show usage help for invalid input
- Proceeded with restore/delete without confirmation

**VIOLATION RECOVERY PROTOCOL:**
```
1. STOP immediately
2. STATE: "I violated PHASE 1 by [specific action]. Correcting now."
3. RETURN to phase validation
4. COMPLETE the phase properly
5. RESUME only after phase passes verification
```

## 4. ⚡ SUBCOMMAND: CREATE

### Usage
```
/memory:checkpoint create "before-refactor"
```

### Instructions

1. **Validate Name** (from Phase 1)
   - Alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores only
   - Max 50 characters
   - No spaces

2. **Execute MCP Call**
   ```
   spec_kit_memory_checkpoint_create({
     name: "<checkpoint_name>",
     specFolder: "<folder>",  // Optional: limit to specific folder
     metadata: { ... }        // Optional: additional context
   })
   ```

3. **Enforce Limits**
   - Max 10 checkpoints allowed
   - If limit exceeded: oldest checkpoint auto-deleted
   - Auto-cleanup: remove checkpoints older than 30 days

4. **Display Result**
   ```
   ✅ Checkpoint Created

      Name: before-refactor
      Memories captured: 47
      Spec folders: 5

   STATUS=OK CHECKPOINT=before-refactor ACTION=create
   ```

---

## 5. ⚡ SUBCOMMAND: RESTORE

### Usage
```
/memory:checkpoint restore "before-refactor"
```

### Instructions

1. **Load Checkpoint via MCP**
   ```
   spec_kit_memory_checkpoint_list({})
   ```
   Verify checkpoint exists.

2. **Show Diff Summary**
   ```
   Restoring checkpoint 'before-refactor'

   Changes detected:
      - 12 memories added since checkpoint (will be removed)
      - 3 memories deleted since checkpoint (will be restored)
      - 2 memories modified since checkpoint (will be reverted)

   Confirm? [y]es, [n]o, [v]iew diff
   ```

3. **Wait for Confirmation** (MANDATORY)
   - If `y` → Execute restore
   - If `n` → Cancel operation
   - If `v` → Show detailed diff, then re-prompt

4. **Execute Restore**
   ```
   spec_kit_memory_checkpoint_restore({
     name: "<checkpoint_name>",
     clearExisting: false  // Set true to wipe current state first
   })
   ```

5. **Display Result**
   ```
   ✅ Checkpoint Restored

      Name: before-refactor
      Memories removed: 12
      Memories marked for recovery: 3

   STATUS=OK CHECKPOINT=before-refactor ACTION=restore
   ```

### ⚠️ CAUTION

Restore behavior depends on the options you pass:
- **Default (`clearExisting=false`)**: Scoped restores mark existing memories in that spec folder as `deprecated` so you can inspect them later. Global restores leave other folders untouched.
- **`clearExisting=true`**: Deletes the existing memories within the scope before inserting the snapshot. Use this only when you need a full rollback.
- **Embeddings**: Restored memories are inserted with `embedding_status=pending`. Always run `memory_index_scan` after a restore to regenerate embeddings.
- Always create a fresh checkpoint before running restore.

## 11. 💡 USE CASES

### Before Major Refactors
```
User: Create a checkpoint before I start the auth refactor
AI: /memory:checkpoint create "pre-auth-refactor"
    ✅ Checkpoint 'pre-auth-refactor' created (47 memories)

[... work happens, things go wrong ...]

User: Restore to before the refactor
AI: /memory:checkpoint restore "pre-auth-refactor"
```

### Context Switching Between Features
```
User: I need to switch to the billing feature for a bit
AI: /memory:checkpoint create "auth-wip"

[... work on billing ...]

User: Back to auth work, restore my context
AI: /memory:checkpoint restore "auth-wip"
```

### Experimentation
```
User: Let me try a different approach, but save current state first
AI: /memory:checkpoint create "approach-a"

[... try different approach ...]

User: That didn't work, go back
AI: /memory:checkpoint restore "approach-a"
```

---

## 12. ⚙️ CONFIGURATION

Configuration is handled internally by the MCP server. Default values:

| Setting        | Default                   | Description                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `max_count`    | 10                        | Maximum checkpoints allowed |
| `max_age_days` | 30                        | Auto-delete after N days    |
| `storage_path` | `.opencode/checkpoints`   | Runtime storage location    |

These defaults are enforced by the Spec Kit Memory MCP server and cannot be overridden via configuration files.

---

## 13. 📌 LIMITATIONS

1. **Cannot fully restore deleted memories**: When a memory is deleted from the database, restoring a checkpoint cannot recreate it. The checkpoint only records metadata, not full content.

2. **Embedding data not preserved**: Checkpoints capture metadata but not vector embeddings. Restored memories will retain their original embeddings if they still exist.

3. **Cross-session limitations**: Checkpoints are local to the workspace and may not transfer between machines.

## 16. 🏛️ CONSTITUTIONAL TIER HANDLING

**IMPORTANT:** Constitutional tier memories receive special treatment during checkpoint operations:

### Create
- Constitutional memories ARE included in checkpoints
- They are marked with `tier: constitutional` in the checkpoint metadata

### Restore
- Constitutional memories from the checkpoint are restored normally
- **Warning:** If constitutional memories were added AFTER the checkpoint, they will be removed on restore
- Consider: Constitutional memories often contain critical rules - verify before restoring older checkpoints

### Best Practice
Before restoring a checkpoint that predates constitutional memory additions:
1. Review current constitutional memories: `memory_search({ tier: "constitutional" })`
2. Note any that should be preserved
3. After restore, manually re-promote critical rules if needed:
   ```typescript
   memory_update({ id: <id>, importanceTier: "constitutional" })
   ```

### Example: Gate 3 Enforcement Memory
Memory #132 is a constitutional memory for Gate 3 enforcement. If restoring a checkpoint from before this was created, you would need to re-create it after restore.
