# 🚨 MANDATORY PHASES - BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT

**These phases use CONSOLIDATED PROMPTS to minimize user round-trips. Each phase BLOCKS until complete. You CANNOT proceed to the workflow until ALL phases show ✅ PASSED or ⏭️ N/A.**

**Round-trip optimization:** This workflow requires 2-3 user interactions (down from 4).

---

## 🔒 PHASE 1: INPUT COLLECTION

**STATUS: ☐ BLOCKED**

```
EXECUTE THIS CHECK FIRST:

├─ IF $ARGUMENTS is empty, undefined, or whitespace-only (ignoring :auto/:confirm flags):
│   │
│   ├─ ASK user: "What topic would you like to research?"
│   ├─ WAIT for user response (DO NOT PROCEED)
│   ├─ Store response as: research_topic
│   └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED → Proceed to PHASE 2
│
└─ IF $ARGUMENTS contains content:
    ├─ Store as: research_topic
    └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED → Proceed to PHASE 2

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user to provide the research topic before continuing.

⛔ HARD STOP: DO NOT read past this phase until STATUS = ✅ PASSED
⛔ NEVER infer topics from context, screenshots, or conversation history
```

**Phase 1 Output:** `research_topic = ________________`

---

## 🔒 PHASE 2: CONSOLIDATED SETUP (Spec Folder + Execution Mode)

**STATUS: ☐ BLOCKED**

```
EXECUTE AFTER PHASE 1 PASSES:

1. CHECK for mode suffix in command invocation:
   ├─ ":auto" suffix detected → execution_mode = "AUTONOMOUS" (pre-set, still ask Q1)
   ├─ ":confirm" suffix detected → execution_mode = "INTERACTIVE" (pre-set, still ask Q1)
   └─ No suffix → execution_mode = "ASK" (include Q2 in consolidated prompt)

2. Search for related spec folders:
   $ ls -d specs/*/ 2>/dev/null | tail -10

3. ASK user with CONSOLIDATED prompt (bundle applicable questions):

   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ **Before proceeding, please answer:**                          │
   │                                                                │
   │ **1. Spec Folder** (required):                                 │
   │    A) Use existing: [suggest if related found]                 │
   │    B) Create new spec folder: specs/[###]-[topic-slug]/        │
   │    C) Update related spec: [if partial match found]            │
   │    D) Skip documentation (research only, no artifacts)         │
   │                                                                │
   │ **2. Execution Mode** (if no :auto/:confirm suffix):             │
   │    A) Autonomous - Execute all 9 steps without approval        │
   │    B) Interactive - Pause at each step for approval            │
   │                                                                │
   │ Reply with choices, e.g.: "B, A" or "A" (if mode pre-set)      │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

4. WAIT for user response (DO NOT PROCEED)

5. Parse response and store results:
   - spec_choice = [A/B/C/D] (first answer)
   - spec_path = [path or null if D]
   - execution_mode = [AUTONOMOUS/INTERACTIVE] (from suffix or second answer)

6. UPDATE SPEC MARKER:
   ├─ Stateless architecture - no .spec-active marker file
   └─ Spec folder is passed via CLI argument

7. SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user to select A/B/C/D and execution mode before continuing.

⛔ HARD STOP: DO NOT proceed until user explicitly answers
⛔ NEVER auto-create spec folders without user confirmation
⛔ NEVER auto-select execution mode without suffix or explicit choice
```

**Phase 2 Output:** `spec_choice = ___` | `spec_path = ________________` | `execution_mode = ________________`

---

## 🔒 PHASE 3: PRIOR WORK SEARCH (Conditional)

**STATUS: ☐ AUTO-EXECUTE**

```
EXECUTE AFTER PHASE 2 PASSES:

1. Call memory_match_triggers(prompt=research_topic) for fast keyword match
2. Call memory_search(query=research_topic, includeConstitutional=true) for semantic search
3. IF matches found:
   ├─ Display: "Found [N] related memories from prior research"
   ├─ ASK user:
   │   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │   │ "Load related prior work?"                         │
   │   │                                                    │
   │   │ A) Load all matches (comprehensive context)        │
   │   │ B) Load constitutional only (foundational rules)   │
   │   │ C) Skip (start fresh)                              │
   │   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED
4. IF no matches found:
   └─ SET STATUS: ⏭️ N/A (no prior work)

⛔ Constitutional tier memories are ALWAYS loaded regardless of choice (they surface automatically with similarity: 100)
```

---

## 🔒 PHASE 4: MEMORY CONTEXT LOADING (Conditional)

**STATUS: ☐ BLOCKED / ☐ N/A**

```
EXECUTE AFTER PHASE 2 PASSES:

CHECK spec_choice value from Phase 2:

├─ IF spec_choice == D (Skip):
│   └─ SET STATUS: ⏭️ N/A (no spec folder, no memory)
│
├─ IF spec_choice == B (Create new):
│   └─ SET STATUS: ⏭️ N/A (new folder has no memory)
│
└─ IF spec_choice == A or C (Use existing):
    │
    ├─ Check: Does spec_path/memory/ exist AND contain files?
    │
    ├─ IF memory/ is empty or missing:
    │   └─ SET STATUS: ⏭️ N/A (no memory to load)
    │
    └─ IF memory/ has files:
        │
        ├─ ASK user:
        │   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │   │ "Load previous context from this spec folder?"     │
        │   │                                                    │
        │   │ A) Load most recent memory file (quick refresh)     │
        │   │ B) Load all recent files, up to 3 (comprehensive)   │
        │   │ C) List all files and select specific                │
        │   │ D) Skip (start fresh, no context)                  │
        │   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        ├─ WAIT for user response
        ├─ Execute loading based on choice (use Read tool)
        ├─ Acknowledge loaded context briefly
        └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user to select memory loading option before continuing.

⛔ HARD STOP: DO NOT proceed until STATUS = ✅ PASSED or ⏭️ N/A
```

**Phase 4 Output:** `memory_loaded = [yes/no]` | `context_summary = ________________`

---

## ✅ PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION (BLOCKING)

**Before continuing to the workflow, verify ALL phases:**

| PHASE                      | REQUIRED STATUS   | YOUR STATUS | OUTPUT VALUE                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| PHASE 1: INPUT             | ✅ PASSED          | ______      | research_topic: ______                        |
| PHASE 2: SETUP (Spec+Mode) | ✅ PASSED          | ______      | spec_choice: ___ / spec_path: ___ / mode: ___ |
| PHASE 3: PRIOR WORK        | ✅ PASSED or ⏭️ N/A | ______      | prior_work_loaded: ______                     |
| PHASE 4: MEMORY            | ✅ PASSED or ⏭️ N/A | ______      | memory_loaded: ______                         |

```
VERIFICATION CHECK:
├─ ALL phases show ✅ PASSED or ⏭️ N/A?
│   ├─ YES → Proceed to "# SpecKit Research" section below
│   └─ NO  → STOP and complete the blocked phase
```

---

## ⚠️ VIOLATION SELF-DETECTION (BLOCKING)

**YOU ARE IN VIOLATION IF YOU:**
- Started reading the workflow section before all phases passed
- Proceeded without asking user for research topic (Phase 1)
- Asked spec folder and execution mode as SEPARATE questions instead of consolidated (Phase 2)
- Auto-created or assumed a spec folder without A/B/C/D choice (Phase 2)
- Skipped memory prompt when using existing folder with memory files (Phase 3)
- Inferred topic from context instead of explicit user input
- Auto-selected execution mode without suffix or explicit user choice

**VIOLATION RECOVERY PROTOCOL:**
```
1. STOP immediately - do not continue current action
2. STATE: "I violated PHASE [X] by [specific action]. Correcting now."
3. RETURN to the violated phase
4. COMPLETE the phase properly (ask user, wait for response)
5. RESUME only after all phases pass verification
```

### Execution Mode Behaviors

| Mode        | Invocation              | Behavior                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `:auto`     | `/spec_kit:research:auto "topic"` | Execute all 9 steps without approval gates |
| `:confirm`  | `/spec_kit:research:confirm "topic"` | Pause at each step for user approval |
| (default)   | `/spec_kit:research "topic"` | Ask user to choose mode during Phase 2 |

### Mode Examples

**:auto mode** - Full autonomy, no confirmation gates:
```
/spec_kit:research:auto "How does the authentication system work?"

Behavior:
- Phase 1: Parses "How does the authentication system work?" as topic
- Phase 2: Asks spec folder question ONLY (mode pre-set to AUTONOMOUS)
- Steps 1-9: Execute sequentially without pausing for approval
- Output: Complete research.md with all 17 sections
```

**:confirm mode** - Pause at each phase for approval:
```
/spec_kit:research:confirm "Evaluate migration options for Postgres to MySQL"

Behavior:
- Phase 1: Parses topic
- Phase 2: Asks spec folder question ONLY (mode pre-set to INTERACTIVE)
- Step 1: Shows scope analysis → "Approve scope? [Y/n]"
- Step 3: Shows codebase findings → "Proceed to external research? [Y/n]"
- Step 5: Shows technical analysis → "Approve recommendations? [Y/n]"
- ...continues with approval gates at each step
```

**Default mode** - User chooses during setup:
```
/spec_kit:research "Compare WebSocket vs SSE for real-time updates"

Behavior:
- Phase 1: Parses topic
- Phase 2: Asks BOTH questions:
  1. Spec Folder: A/B/C/D
  2. Execution Mode: A) Autonomous or B) Interactive
- User responds: "B, A" (new spec folder, autonomous execution)
- Proceeds with autonomous execution
```

### Mode Selection Guidance

| Scenario                                      | Recommended Mode |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Quick research, known domain                  | `:auto`          |
| Complex topic, need validation at each step   | `:confirm`       |
| First time researching unfamiliar area        | `:confirm`       |
| Re-running research with minor scope changes  | `:auto`          |
| Multi-stakeholder decision requiring review   | `:confirm`       |

## 8. 🔀 PARALLEL DISPATCH

The research workflow supports parallel agent dispatch for investigation-heavy phases. This is configured in the YAML prompts.

### Complexity Scoring Algorithm (5 dimensions)

| Dimension            | Weight | Scoring                                |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Domain Count         | 35%    | 1=0.0, 2=0.5, 3+=1.0                   |
| File Count           | 25%    | 1-2=0.0, 3-5=0.5, 6+=1.0               |
| LOC Estimate         | 15%    | <50=0.0, 50-200=0.5, >200=1.0          |
| Parallel Opportunity | 20%    | sequential=0.0, some=0.5, high=1.0     |
| Task Type            | 5%     | trivial=0.0, moderate=0.5, complex=1.0 |

### Decision Thresholds

- **<20%**: Proceed directly (no parallel agents)
- **≥20% + 2 domains**: ALWAYS ask user before dispatch

### Eligible Phases

- `step_3_codebase_investigation` - Pattern exploration and architecture analysis
- `step_4_external_research` - Documentation and best practices research
- `step_5_technical_analysis` - Feasibility and risk assessment

### User Override Phrases

- `"proceed directly"` / `"handle directly"` → Skip parallel dispatch
- `"use parallel"` / `"dispatch agents"` → Force parallel dispatch
- `"auto-decide"` → Enable session auto-mode (1 hour)

---

## 8.5 🧠 MEMORY INTEGRATION

Memory integration ensures research builds on prior work and preserves findings for future sessions.

### Before Starting Research

```
1. TRIGGER CHECK:
   memory_match_triggers(prompt=research_topic)
   → Returns: keywords that match existing memories

2. SEMANTIC SEARCH:
   memory_search({
     query: research_topic,
     anchors: ['research', 'findings', 'decisions'],
     includeConstitutional: true
   })
   → Returns: Relevant prior research with similarity scores

3. LOAD CONTEXT:
   IF matches found with similarity > 70:
     - Display summary of prior findings
     - Ask user: "Build on this or start fresh?"
   IF constitutional memories found:
     - Always load (these are foundational rules)
```

### After Completing Research

```
1. GENERATE CONTEXT:
   node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/memory/generate-context.js [spec-folder]

2. ANCHOR TAGGING:
   The script automatically extracts and indexes:
   - ANCHOR:research-[topic] → Identifies the research topic
   - ANCHOR:findings → Key discoveries
   - ANCHOR:recommendations → Action items
   - ANCHOR:decisions → Choices made and rationale

3. VERIFY SAVE:
   Check memory/*.md file created with proper anchors
```

### Memory Search Patterns for Research

| Research Phase      | Memory Query                                           | Purpose                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Before Step 1       | `memory_search({ query: topic })`                      | Find prior related research   |
| During Step 3       | `memory_search({ anchors: ['architecture'] })`         | Existing patterns/decisions   |
| During Step 4       | `memory_search({ anchors: ['external-research'] })`    | Prior external source findings |
| After Step 9        | `generate-context.js [spec-folder]`                    | Preserve current research     |

### Memory Integration Example

```
Research Topic: "WebSocket implementation patterns"

1. Pre-Research Check:
   memory_match_triggers("WebSocket implementation patterns")
   → Matches: ["websocket", "real-time", "connections"]

2. Semantic Search:
   memory_search({
     query: "WebSocket implementation patterns",
     anchors: ["research", "architecture"]
   })
   → Found: "2025-01-15__websocket-evaluation.md" (similarity: 85)

3. User Prompt:
   "Found prior research on WebSocket evaluation from Jan 15.
    A) Build on prior findings
    B) Start fresh (ignore prior work)
    C) Review prior findings first"

4. Post-Research Save:
   node generate-context.js specs/007-websocket-impl/
   → Creates: memory/2025-01-23__websocket-patterns.md
   → Indexed with anchors: research-websocket, findings, recommendations
```

## 9. 🤖 AGENT ROUTING

This command routes Steps 3-7 to the specialized `@research` agent when available.

| Step | Agent | Fallback | Purpose |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| Steps 3-7 (Investigation) | `@research` | `general` | 9-step research workflow with comprehensive findings |

### How Agent Routing Works

1. **Detection**: When Steps 3-7 are reached, the system checks if `@research` agent is available
2. **Dispatch**: If available, dispatches to `@research` agent with research topic and spec path
3. **Fallback**: If agent unavailable, falls back to `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (Claude Code) or `"general"` (OpenCode) with warning
4. **Output**: Agent returns structured findings for research.md compilation

### Agent Dispatch Template

```
Task tool with prompt:
---
You are the @research agent. Execute your 9-step research workflow.

Topic: {research_topic}
Spec Folder: {spec_path}

Execute Steps 3-7 of your workflow:
- Step 3: Codebase Investigation
- Step 4: External Research
- Step 5: Technical Analysis
- Step 6: Quality Checklist
- Step 7: Solution Design

Return structured findings for research.md compilation.
---
```

### Fallback Behavior

When `@research` agent is unavailable:
- Warning message: "Research agent unavailable, using general dispatch"
- Workflow continues with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (Claude Code) or `"general"` (OpenCode)
- Same steps executed, potentially less specialized output

---

## 10. ✅ QUALITY GATES

Quality gates enforce validation at critical workflow stages to ensure research quality and completeness.

### Gate Configuration

| Gate           | Location         | Purpose                                      | Threshold |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Pre-execution  | Before Step 1    | Validate inputs and prerequisites            | Score ≥70 |
| Mid-execution  | After Step 5     | Verify research progress and quality         | Score ≥70 |
| Post-execution | After Step 9     | Confirm all deliverables meet standards      | Score ≥70 |

### Gate Behavior

- **Score ≥ 70** = PASS - Proceed to next phase
- **Score < 70** = FAIL - Block progression, require remediation

### Pre-Execution Gate Checks

```
□ Research topic clearly defined and scoped
□ Spec folder path valid or auto-creation confirmed
□ No blocking dependencies or missing prerequisites
□ Execution mode (auto/confirm) established
```

### Mid-Execution Gate Checks

```
□ Steps 1-5 completed with documented outputs
□ Technical analysis has verifiable findings
□ No unresolved critical blockers
□ Research direction validated (confidence ≥40%)
```

### Post-Execution Gate Checks

```
□ research.md exists with all 17 sections populated
□ Key questions from Step 1 are answered
□ Quality checklist items verified (Level 2+)
□ Context saved to memory/ folder
```

## 11. 🔌 CIRCUIT BREAKER

The circuit breaker prevents cascading failures by isolating problematic operations and enabling graceful recovery.

### States

| State     | Behavior                                             | Transition Trigger              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| CLOSED    | Normal operation, all requests processed             | Default state                   |
| OPEN      | All requests blocked, fast-fail immediately          | failure_threshold (3) reached   |
| HALF-OPEN | Limited requests allowed to test recovery            | recovery_timeout (60s) elapsed  |

### Configuration

| Parameter          | Value | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| failure_threshold  | 3     | Consecutive failures before OPEN state   |
| recovery_timeout   | 60    | Seconds before attempting recovery       |
| half_open_requests | 1     | Test requests allowed in HALF-OPEN state |

### Tracked Errors

The circuit breaker monitors these error categories:

- `tool_timeout` - Tool execution exceeds timeout limit
- `tool_error` - Tool returns error response
- `validation_failure` - Output fails validation checks
- `agent_dispatch_failure` - Sub-agent dispatch fails
- `memory_operation_failure` - Memory save/load operations fail

### Recovery Protocol

```
1. OPEN state entered:
   - Log: "Circuit breaker OPEN - research workflow paused"
   - Action: Save current progress to checkpoint
   - Notify: Present recovery options to user

2. After recovery_timeout (60s):
   - Transition to HALF-OPEN
   - Log: "Circuit breaker HALF-OPEN - testing recovery"
   - Allow 1 test request

3. Test request result:
   - SUCCESS → Transition to CLOSED, resume workflow
   - FAILURE → Return to OPEN, reset recovery_timeout
```

### User Recovery Options (OPEN State)

```
A) Retry - Reset circuit breaker and retry failed operation
B) Skip - Skip failed step and continue (if non-critical)
C) Abort - Save context and terminate workflow gracefully
D) Debug - Invoke /spec_kit:debug for detailed analysis
```

### Circuit Breaker Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Source Unavailable (tool_error)**

```
Attempt 1: WebFetch("https://api.example.com/docs") → 404 Not Found
           Action: Log error, try alternate source (cache, mirror)
           State: CLOSED (failure count: 1)

Attempt 2: WebFetch("https://docs.example.com/api") → Connection timeout
           Action: Log error, try local cache
           State: CLOSED (failure count: 2)

Attempt 3: Read("/docs/cached-api-docs.md") → File not found
           Action: Circuit OPENS, present recovery options
           State: OPEN (failure threshold reached)

Recovery: After 60s → HALF-OPEN
          Test: WebFetch original URL
          Success → CLOSED, continue research
          Failure → Return to OPEN, extend timeout to 90s
```

**Scenario 2: Conflicting Evidence (validation_failure)**

```
Step 3 (Codebase Investigation):
  Finding A: "Auth uses JWT" [SOURCE: src/auth/token.ts:15]
  Grade: A (Primary, verified)

Step 4 (External Research):
  Finding B: "System uses session-based auth" [DOC: internal-wiki/auth]
  Grade: B (Secondary, documentation)

Conflict Detected: Contradictory authentication claims
  Action: Circuit transitions to HALF-OPEN
  Behavior: Pause, request user resolution

User Prompt:
  "Conflicting evidence detected:
   - Code shows JWT tokens (Grade A evidence)
   - Wiki says session-based (Grade B evidence)

   A) Trust codebase (JWT) - code is source of truth
   B) Trust documentation - code may be outdated
   C) Investigate further - need more evidence"

Resolution: User selects A
  Action: CLOSED, mark wiki as Grade D (outdated)
  Continue: Research proceeds with JWT as confirmed approach
```

**Scenario 3: Agent Dispatch Failure (agent_dispatch_failure)**

```
Task: Dispatch @research agent for Step 4

Attempt 1: Task tool timeout (120s exceeded)
           Action: Log, retry with smaller scope
           State: CLOSED (failure count: 1)

Attempt 2: Task tool returns partial result
           Action: Accept partial, retry remainder
           State: CLOSED (failure count: 2)

Attempt 3: Task tool returns error "context exceeded"
           Action: Circuit OPENS
           State: OPEN

Recovery Options Presented:
  A) Retry with reduced scope (split into sub-tasks)
  B) Skip external research, use cached data
  C) Abort and save progress
  D) Debug with /spec_kit:debug
```

**Scenario 4: Memory Operation Failure (memory_operation_failure)**

```
Step 9 (Save Context): generate-context.js execution

Attempt 1: Script error "Database locked"
           Action: Wait 5s, retry
           State: CLOSED (failure count: 1)

Attempt 2: Script error "Disk full"
           Action: Circuit OPENS immediately (critical failure)
           State: OPEN

Recovery:
  - Alert: "Memory save failed - disk may be full"
  - Offer: "Export findings to clipboard instead?"
  - Action: Save to scratch/ as backup if user approves
```

## 12. 🎭 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM OTHER COMMANDS

- **Does NOT proceed to implementation** - Terminates after research.md
- **Primary output is research.md** - Comprehensive technical documentation
- **Use case** - Technical uncertainty, feasibility analysis, documentation
- **Next steps** - Can feed into `/spec_kit:plan` or `/spec_kit:complete`

---

## 13. 🔍 EXAMPLES

**Example 1: Multi-Integration Feature**
```
/spec_kit:research:auto "Webflow CMS integration with external payment gateway and email service"
```

**Example 2: Complex Architecture**
```
/spec_kit:research:confirm "Real-time collaboration system with conflict resolution"
```

**Example 3: Performance-Critical Feature**
```
/spec_kit:research "Video streaming optimization for mobile browsers"
```

---

## 14. 🔗 COMMAND CHAIN

This command is part of the SpecKit workflow:

```
/spec_kit:research → [/spec_kit:plan] → [/spec_kit:implement]
```

**Explicit next step:**
→ `/spec_kit:plan [feature-description]` (use research findings to inform planning)

---

## 15. 📌 NEXT STEPS

After research completes, suggest relevant next steps:

| Condition | Suggested Command | Reason |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Research complete, ready to plan | `/spec_kit:plan [feature-description]` | Use findings to create spec and plan |
| Need more investigation | `/spec_kit:research [new-topic]` | Deeper dive on specific area |
| Research reveals blockers | Document in research.md | Capture constraints before planning |
| Need to pause work | `/spec_kit:handover [spec-folder-path]` | Save context for later |
| Want to save context | `/memory:save [spec-folder-path]` | Preserve research findings |

**ALWAYS** end with: "What would you like to do next?"
