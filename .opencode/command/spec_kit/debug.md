# 🚨 SINGLE CONSOLIDATED PROMPT - ONE USER INTERACTION

**This workflow uses a SINGLE consolidated prompt to gather ALL required inputs in ONE user interaction.**

**Round-trip optimization:** This workflow requires only 1 user interaction (all questions asked together).

**Key Rule:** Model selection is MANDATORY and included in the consolidated prompt.

---

## 🔒 UNIFIED SETUP PHASE

**STATUS: ☐ BLOCKED**

```
EXECUTE THIS SINGLE CONSOLIDATED PROMPT:

1. CHECK for spec folder in $ARGUMENTS:
   ├─ IF $ARGUMENTS contains a spec folder path → validate and store
   └─ IF $ARGUMENTS is empty → auto-detect from recent memory files

2. Auto-detect spec folder if needed:
   - Glob("specs/**/memory/*.md") → Sort by modification time, take first
   - IF found: spec_path = extracted path, detection_method = "recent"
   - IF not found: detection_method = "none" (include Q0 in prompt)

3. GATHER ERROR CONTEXT from conversation (background scan):
   - Scan for: error messages, stack traces, affected files, previous attempts
   - IF found: Store as error_message, affected_files, previous_attempts
   - IF not found: Include Q1 in prompt

4. ASK user with SINGLE CONSOLIDATED prompt (include only applicable questions):

   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ **Before proceeding, please answer:**                          │
   │                                                                │
   │ **Q0. Spec Folder** (if not detected/provided):                │
   │    Available spec folders: [list if found]                     │
   │    A) Use: [most recent if detected]                           │
   │    B) Select different folder (specify path)                   │
   │    C) Debug without spec folder (ad-hoc mode)                  │
   │    D) Cancel                                                   │
   │                                                                │
   │ **Q1. Error Context** (if not found in conversation):          │
   │    What error are you debugging? Please provide:               │
   │    • The error message or unexpected behavior                  │
   │    • Which file(s) are affected                                 │
   │    • What you've already tried (if anything)                   │
   │                                                                │
   │ **Q2. AI Model** (required):                                   │
   │    A) Claude - Anthropic (Recommended)                         │
   │    B) Gemini - Google                                          │
   │    C) Codex - OpenAI                                           │
   │    D) Other - Specify                                          │
   │                                                                │
   │ **Q3. Dispatch Mode** (required):                              │
   │    A) Single Agent - One agent (Recommended)                   │
   │    B) Multi-Agent (1+2) - 1 orchestrator + 2 hypothesis gen    │
   │    C) Multi-Agent (1+3) - 1 orchestrator + 3 hypothesis gen    │
   │                                                                │
   │ Reply with answers, e.g.: "A, A, A" or "A, [error desc], A, A" │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

5. WAIT for user response (DO NOT PROCEED)

6. Parse response and store ALL results:
   - spec_path = [from Q0 or auto-detected or $ARGUMENTS]
   - detection_method = [provided/recent/ad-hoc]
   - error_message = [from Q1 or extracted from conversation]
   - affected_files = [extracted or from Q1]
   - previous_attempts = [extracted or from Q1]
   - selected_model = [from Q2]
   - dispatch_mode = [single/multi_small/multi_large from Q3]

7. IF dispatch_mode is multi_*:
   - Note: Orchestrator handles OBSERVE + FIX phases
   - Note: Workers handle parallel hypothesis generation in ANALYZE phase

8. SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user to answer ALL applicable questions before continuing.

⛔ HARD STOP: DO NOT proceed until user explicitly answers
⛔ NEVER skip model selection - it is MANDATORY
⛔ NEVER skip dispatch mode selection - it is MANDATORY
⛔ NEVER split these questions into multiple prompts
```

**Phase Output:**
- `spec_path = ________________` | `detection_method = ________________`
- `error_message = ________________`
- `affected_files = ________________`
- `selected_model = ________________`
- `dispatch_mode = ________________`

---

## ⚡ GATE 3 CLARIFICATION

**When Gate 3 applies:** When debugging leads to file modifications (Step 5, Option A "Apply the fix").

- If a spec folder was established in unified setup → Gate 3 is satisfied
- If ad-hoc mode was selected → Gate 3 MUST be asked before applying fixes:
  > **Spec Folder** (required): A) Existing | B) New | C) Update related | D) Skip

**Self-Verification:** Before applying any fix:
> □ STOP. File modification detected? Did I ask spec folder question? If NO → Ask NOW.

---

## ✅ PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION (BLOCKING)

**Before continuing to the workflow, verify ALL values are set:**

| FIELD            | REQUIRED      | YOUR VALUE | SOURCE                     |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| spec_path        | ○ Conditional | ______     | Q0 or auto-detect or $ARGS |
| detection_method | ✅ Yes         | ______     | Auto-determined            |
| error_message    | ✅ Yes         | ______     | Q1 or conversation scan    |
| selected_model   | ✅ Yes         | ______     | Q2                         |
| dispatch_mode    | ✅ Yes         | ______     | Q3                         |

```
VERIFICATION CHECK:
├─ ALL required fields have values?
│   ├─ YES → Proceed to "# /spec_kit:debug" section below
│   └─ NO  → Re-prompt for missing values only
```

---

## ⚠️ VIOLATION SELF-DETECTION (BLOCKING)

**YOU ARE IN VIOLATION IF YOU:**
- Started reading the workflow section before all fields are set
- Asked questions in MULTIPLE separate prompts instead of ONE consolidated prompt
- Skipped model selection (Q2 is MANDATORY)
- Skipped dispatch mode selection (Q3 is MANDATORY)
- Assumed single-agent mode without explicit user choice
- Dispatched sub-agent without creating debug-delegation.md first
- Did not wait for user response on integration options

**VIOLATION RECOVERY PROTOCOL:**
```
1. STOP immediately - do not continue current action
2. STATE: "I asked questions separately instead of consolidated. Correcting now."
3. PRESENT the single consolidated prompt with ALL applicable questions
4. WAIT for user response
5. RESUME only after all fields are set
```

## 6. 📌 REFERENCE

### Error Categories

| Category      | Indicators                                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| syntax_error  | Parse errors, unexpected tokens, brackets      |
| type_error    | Type mismatch, undefined properties, TS errors |
| runtime_error | Exceptions during execution, crashes           |
| test_failure  | Assertion failures, test timeouts              |
| build_error   | Compilation failures, bundling errors          |
| lint_error    | Linter errors, code style violations           |

| Universal debugging | `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/references/debugging/universal_debugging_methodology.md` |

### Validation Integration

Before or during debugging, validation runs automatically to catch common issues:
- Missing required files (FILE_EXISTS)
- Unfilled placeholders (PLACEHOLDER_FILLED)
- Missing priority tags in checklist (PRIORITY_TAGS)
- Broken memory anchors (ANCHORS_VALID)

---

## 7. 🔀 SUB-AGENT DELEGATION

This command uses the Task tool to dispatch the specialized `@debug` agent for debugging. The sub-agent runs independently with fresh perspective and returns structured findings.

### Delegation Architecture

```
Main Agent (reads command):
├── PHASE 1: Context Detection (validation)
├── PHASE 2: Model Selection (mandatory)
├── Step 2: Generate debug-delegation.md (context handoff)
├── DISPATCH: Task tool with @debug agent
│   ├── @debug receives structured handoff (NOT conversation history)
│   ├── @debug executes 4-phase methodology
│   │   ├── Phase 1: OBSERVE (read error, categorize, map scope)
│   │   ├── Phase 2: ANALYZE (trace paths, understand flow)
│   │   ├── Phase 3: HYPOTHESIZE (form 2-3 ranked theories)
│   │   └── Phase 4: FIX (minimal change, verify)
│   └── @debug returns structured response (Success/Blocked/Escalation)
└── Step 5: Integration (always main agent)
```

### @debug Agent Dispatch Template

```
Task tool with prompt:
---
You are the @debug agent. Follow your 4-phase debugging methodology.

## Debug Context Handoff

### Error Description
{error_message}

### Files Involved
{affected_files}

### Reproduction Steps
{reproduction_steps}

### Prior Attempts (What Was Tried)
{previous_attempts}

### Environment
{environment_context}

Execute your OBSERVE → ANALYZE → HYPOTHESIZE → FIX methodology.
Return your findings in structured format (Success/Blocked/Escalation).
---
subagent_type: "debug"
```

### Sub-Agent Isolation (By Design)

The `@debug` agent does NOT have access to conversation history. This is intentional:
- **Prevents inherited assumptions** from failed attempts
- **Fresh perspective** may see what others missed
- **All context** must be passed via structured handoff format

### Context Handoff Format

The debug-delegation.md report MUST include:

| Section            | Required | Purpose                          |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Error Description  | ✓        | Exact error message, symptoms    |
| Files Involved     | ✓        | Affected files with roles        |
| Reproduction Steps | ✓        | How to trigger the error         |
| Prior Attempts     | ✓        | What was tried and why it failed |
| Environment        | ○        | Runtime, versions, config        |

### Model Hint

The selected model (Claude/Gemini/Codex) is passed as context to help route to appropriate capabilities. The Task tool uses the model configured in your OpenCode environment.

### Timeout & Retry

- **Timeout:** 2 minutes (standard)
- **Retry Limit:** Maximum 3 re-dispatch attempts before forcing escalation
- **Escalation:** After 3 failed hypotheses, @debug returns ESCALATION response

---

## 8. 🔍 EXAMPLES

**Example 1: Auto-detect with recent error**
```
/spec_kit:debug
```
→ Auto-detects spec folder, gathers error from conversation, asks for model, dispatches

**Example 2: Specific spec folder**
```
/spec_kit:debug specs/007-anobel.com/004-table-of-content/
```
→ Uses specified folder, gathers error context, asks for model, dispatches

**Example 3: After multiple failed attempts**
```
User: This TypeScript error keeps coming back after 3 fix attempts
Agent: Let me delegate this to a fresh debugging agent...
/spec_kit:debug
```
→ Creates comprehensive delegation report with all 3 attempts documented

## 9. 🔗 RELATED COMMANDS

| Command              | Relationship                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/spec_kit:complete` | Start feature work (debug when issues arise)    |
| `/spec_kit:handover` | Create handover (debug documents issue context) |
| `/spec_kit:resume`   | Resume work (may need debug after resuming)     |

---

## 10. 📌 INTEGRATION

### @debug Agent Integration

The debug command dispatches to the specialized `@debug` agent (`.opencode/agent/debug.md`):
- **4-phase methodology:** Observe → Analyze → Hypothesize → Fix
- **Codebase-agnostic:** Works with any technology stack
- **Isolation by design:** No conversation history, only structured handoff
- **Structured responses:** Success, Blocked, or Escalation format

### @debug Agent Response Types

| Response       | Meaning                       | Next Action                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Success**    | Root cause found, fix applied | Verify fix, continue work            |
| **Blocked**    | Missing info or access issue  | Provide requested info               |
| **Escalation** | 3+ hypotheses failed          | Try different model or manual review |

### Memory Integration

After successful resolution:
- Consider running `/memory:save` to capture debugging insights
- Debug-delegation.md serves as memory for the spec folder
- Future agents can learn from documented fix attempts

---

## 11. 🔗 COMMAND CHAIN

This command can be invoked from any workflow:

```
[/spec_kit:implement] → /spec_kit:debug → [Return to original workflow]
[/spec_kit:complete] → /spec_kit:debug → [Return to original workflow]
```

**After resolution:**
→ Return to the original workflow step that triggered debugging

---

## 12. 📌 NEXT STEPS

After debugging completes, suggest relevant next steps:

| Condition                      | Suggested Command                              | Reason                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Fix applied successfully       | Verify in browser/tests                        | Confirm fix works             |
| Fix applied, continue work     | Return to original workflow                    | Resume implementation         |
| Issue needs more analysis      | `/spec_kit:debug` (retry with different model) | Fresh perspective             |
| Want to save debugging context | `/memory:save [spec-folder-path]`              | Preserve debugging insights   |
| Debugging session complete     | `/spec_kit:handover [spec-folder-path]`        | Document for future reference |

**ALWAYS** end with: "What would you like to do next?"
