## ⛔ GATE 3 COMPLIANCE

This command involves FILE MODIFICATIONS. Per AGENTS.md Section 2, Gate 3 MUST be satisfied before implementation.

**Standard Gate 3 Question Format:**
> **Spec Folder** (required): A) Existing | B) New | C) Update related | D) Skip

**First Message Protocol:** If this command is invoked as the user's FIRST message requesting file modifications, the spec folder question is your FIRST response. No analysis first, no tool calls first.

**Failure Pattern #5 Warning (Skip Process):**
> "I already know this" - Triggers: "straightforward", "comprehensive", "fix all", "15 agents"
> Even exciting implementation requests MUST complete Phase 1-3 blocking gates.

**Self-Verification:** Before proceeding to workflow:
> □ STOP. File modification detected? Did I ask spec folder question? If NO → Ask NOW.

---

# 🚨 MANDATORY PHASES - BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT

**These phases use CONSOLIDATED PROMPTS to minimize user round-trips. Each phase BLOCKS until complete. You CANNOT proceed to the workflow until ALL phases show ✅ PASSED or ⏭️ N/A.**

**Round-trip optimization:** This workflow requires 2-3 user interactions (down from 4).

---

## 🔒 PHASE 1: INPUT COLLECTION

**STATUS: ☐ BLOCKED**

```
EXECUTE THIS CHECK FIRST:

├─ IF $ARGUMENTS is empty, undefined, or whitespace-only (ignoring :auto/:confirm flags):
│   │
│   ├─ Search for available spec folders with plan.md:
│   │   $ ls -d specs/*/ 2>/dev/null | tail -10
│   │
│   ├─ ASK user: "Which spec folder would you like to implement?"
│   │   Present found folders with plan.md status
│   ├─ WAIT for user response (DO NOT PROCEED)
│   ├─ Store response as: spec_folder_input
│   └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED → Proceed to PHASE 2
│
└─ IF $ARGUMENTS contains a spec folder path:
    ├─ Store as: spec_folder_input
    └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED → Proceed to PHASE 2

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user to specify or select a spec folder before continuing.

⛔ HARD STOP: DO NOT read past this phase until STATUS = ✅ PASSED
⛔ NEVER infer spec folder from context, .spec-active, or conversation history
```

**Phase 1 Output:** `spec_folder_input = ________________`

---

## 🔒 PHASE 2: CONSOLIDATED SETUP (Validation + Execution Mode)

**STATUS: ☐ BLOCKED**

```
EXECUTE AFTER PHASE 1 PASSES:

1. Validate spec_folder_input exists and has required files:
   $ ls -la [spec_folder_input]/

   Check for:
   - spec.md (REQUIRED)
   - plan.md (REQUIRED)
   - tasks.md (will create if missing)
   - checklist.md (REQUIRED for Level 2+)

2. IF required files missing:
   ├─ INFORM user: "Missing required files: [list]"
   ├─ ASK: "Run /spec_kit:plan first, or select different folder?"
   │   - A) Run /spec_kit:plan to create planning artifacts
   │   - B) Select a different spec folder
   └─ WAIT and redirect accordingly

3. CHECK for mode suffix in command invocation:
   ├─ ":auto" suffix detected → execution_mode = "AUTONOMOUS" (pre-set, still ask Q1)
   ├─ ":confirm" suffix detected → execution_mode = "INTERACTIVE" (pre-set, still ask Q1)
   └─ No suffix → execution_mode = "ASK" (include Q2 in consolidated prompt)

4. IF files exist, ASK user with CONSOLIDATED prompt:

   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ **Before proceeding, please answer:**                          │
   │                                                                │
   │ **1. Confirm Spec Folder** (required):                          │
   │    Folder: [spec_folder_input]                                 │
   │    ├─ spec.md ✓                                                │
   │    ├─ plan.md ✓                                                │
   │    └─ [other files status]                                      │
   │                                                                │
   │    A) Yes, implement this spec folder                          │
   │    B) No, select a different spec folder                       │
   │    C) Cancel - I need to plan first                             │
   │                                                                │
   │ **2. Execution Mode** (if no :auto/:confirm suffix):             │
   │    A) Autonomous - Execute all 9 steps without approval        │
   │    B) Interactive - Pause at each step for approval            │
   │                                                                │
   │ Reply with choices, e.g.: "A, A" or "A" (if mode pre-set)      │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

5. WAIT for user response (DO NOT PROCEED)

6. Parse response:
   ├─ IF user selects B or C for Q1 → redirect accordingly
   └─ IF user selects A for Q1 → store and continue

7. Store results:
   - spec_path = [confirmed path]
   - prerequisites_valid = yes
   - execution_mode = [AUTONOMOUS/INTERACTIVE] (from suffix or Q2 answer)

8. SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED (Stateless - no .spec-active file created)

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user to confirm spec folder and select execution mode before continuing.

⛔ HARD STOP: DO NOT proceed until user explicitly confirms
⛔ NEVER assume spec folder is correct without validation
⛔ NEVER auto-select execution mode without suffix or explicit choice
```

**Phase 2 Output:** `spec_path = ________________` | `prerequisites_valid = [yes/no]` | `execution_mode = ________________`

---

## 🔒 PHASE 3: MEMORY CONTEXT LOADING (Conditional)

**STATUS: ☐ BLOCKED / ☐ N/A**

```
EXECUTE AFTER PHASE 2 PASSES:

1. Check: Does spec_path/memory/ exist AND contain files?

├─ IF memory/ is empty or missing:
│   └─ SET STATUS: ⏭️ N/A (no memory to load)
│
└─ IF memory/ has files:
    │
    ├─ ASK user:
    │   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │   │ "Load previous context from this spec folder?"     │
    │   │                                                    │
    │   │ A) Load most recent memory file (quick refresh)     │
    │   │ B) Load all recent files, up to 3 (comprehensive)   │
    │   │ C) List all files and select specific                │
    │   │ D) Skip (start fresh, no context)                  │
    │   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    │
    ├─ WAIT for user response
    ├─ Execute loading based on choice (use Read tool)
    ├─ Acknowledge loaded context briefly
    └─ SET STATUS: ✅ PASSED

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user to select memory loading option before continuing.

⛔ HARD STOP: DO NOT proceed until STATUS = ✅ PASSED or ⏭️ N/A
```

**Phase 3 Output:** `memory_loaded = [yes/no]` | `context_summary = ________________`

---

## ✅ PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION (BLOCKING)

**Before continuing to the workflow, verify ALL phases:**

| PHASE                       | REQUIRED STATUS   | YOUR STATUS | OUTPUT VALUE                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| PHASE 1: INPUT              | ✅ PASSED          | ______      | spec_folder_input: ______               |
| PHASE 2: SETUP (Valid+Mode) | ✅ PASSED          | ______      | spec_path: ___ / valid: ___ / mode: ___ |
| PHASE 3: MEMORY             | ✅ PASSED or ⏭️ N/A | ______      | memory_loaded: ______                   |

```
VERIFICATION CHECK:
├─ ALL phases show ✅ PASSED or ⏭️ N/A?
│   ├─ YES → Proceed to "# SpecKit Implement" section below
│   └─ NO  → STOP and complete the blocked phase
```

---

## ⚠️ VIOLATION SELF-DETECTION (BLOCKING)

**YOU ARE IN VIOLATION IF YOU:**
- Started reading the workflow section before all phases passed
- Proceeded without asking user for spec folder (Phase 1)
- Asked validation confirmation and execution mode as SEPARATE questions instead of consolidated (Phase 2)
- Started implementation without validating spec folder has required files (Phase 2)
- Skipped memory prompt when memory files exist (Phase 3)
- Inferred spec folder from .spec-active or context instead of explicit user input
- Auto-selected execution mode without suffix or explicit user choice

**VIOLATION RECOVERY PROTOCOL:**
```
1. STOP immediately - do not continue current action
2. STATE: "I violated PHASE [X] by [specific action]. Correcting now."
3. RETURN to the violated phase
4. COMPLETE the phase properly (ask user, wait for response)
5. RESUME only after all phases pass verification
```

**See also:** AGENTS.md Sections 2-4 for memory loading, confidence framework, and request analysis.

---

## 7. 🔀 PARALLEL DISPATCH

The implement workflow supports parallel agent dispatch for complex phases. This is configured in the YAML prompts.

### Complexity Scoring Algorithm (5 dimensions)

| Dimension            | Weight | Scoring                                |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Domain Count         | 35%    | 1=0.0, 2=0.5, 3+=1.0                   |
| File Count           | 25%    | 1-2=0.0, 3-5=0.5, 6+=1.0               |
| LOC Estimate         | 15%    | <50=0.0, 50-200=0.5, >200=1.0          |
| Parallel Opportunity | 20%    | sequential=0.0, some=0.5, high=1.0     |
| Task Type            | 5%     | trivial=0.0, moderate=0.5, complex=1.0 |

### Decision Thresholds

- **<20%**: Proceed directly (no parallel agents)
- **≥20% + 2 domains**: ALWAYS ask user before dispatch

### Eligible Phases

- `step_6_development` - Main implementation phase

### User Override Phrases

- `"proceed directly"` / `"handle directly"` → Skip parallel dispatch
- `"use parallel"` / `"dispatch agents"` → Force parallel dispatch
- `"auto-decide"` → Enable session auto-mode (1 hour)

## 8. 🤖 AGENT ROUTING

This command routes Step 11 (Checklist Verification) to the specialized `@review` agent when available.

| Step | Agent | Fallback | Purpose |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| Step 7 (Completion/Verification) | `@review` | `general` | P0/P1 checklist verification with quality scoring |

### How Agent Routing Works

1. **Detection**: When Step 7 (Completion) is reached, the system checks if `@review` agent is available
2. **Dispatch**: If available, dispatches to `@review` agent with spec path and checklist
3. **Fallback**: If agent unavailable, falls back to `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (Claude Code) or `"general"` (OpenCode) with warning
4. **Output**: Agent returns structured verification result with P0/P1 status and quality score

### Agent Dispatch Template

```
Task tool with prompt:
---
You are the @review agent. Verify implementation completeness.

Spec Folder: {spec_path}
Checklist: {spec_path}/checklist.md

Execute:
1. Load checklist.md
2. Verify ALL P0 items are [x] with evidence
3. Verify ALL P1 items are [x] or have deferral approval
4. Score against quality rubric (100-point scale)

Return:
- P0 status: [PASS/FAIL]
- P1 status: [PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL]
- Quality score: [0-100]
- Blocking issues: [list]
---
```

### Blocking Behavior

**IMPORTANT**: The `@review` agent routing uses `blocking: true`:
- If P0 status is FAIL, workflow **CANNOT** proceed to completion claims
- Clear message shows which P0 items are incomplete
- User must address P0 items before claiming "done"

### Fallback Behavior

When `@review` agent is unavailable:
- Warning message: "Review agent unavailable, using general dispatch"
- Workflow continues with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (Claude Code) or `"general"` (OpenCode)
- Same verification executed, may have less rigorous scoring

---

## 9. ✅ QUALITY GATES

Quality gates enforce minimum standards at key workflow transitions.

### Gate Configuration

| Gate | Location | Threshold | Blocking |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Pre-Implementation | Before Step 6 | 70 | Yes |
| Mid-Implementation | After Step 6.5 | 65 | No (warning only) |
| Post-Implementation | Before Step 7 completion | 70 | Yes |

### Gate Behavior

**Pre-Implementation Gate (Step 5 → Step 6)**
- Evaluates: Prerequisites complete, plan clarity, task breakdown quality
- Score < 70: BLOCK - Cannot start development
- Score ≥ 70: PASS - Proceed to development

**Mid-Implementation Gate (Step 6.5)**
- Evaluates: Code quality, test coverage, task completion rate
- Score < 65: WARNING - Log concern, continue with caution
- Score ≥ 65: PASS - Continue normally

**Post-Implementation Gate (Step 7)**
- Evaluates: All tasks complete, tests pass, checklist verified
- Score < 70: BLOCK - Cannot claim completion
- Score ≥ 70: PASS - Generate implementation-summary.md

**IMPORTANT: @review Agent Blocking**

The `@review` agent routing (Section 8) provides **additional blocking** beyond quality gates:
- Quality gates check score thresholds (numeric)
- `@review` agent checks P0/P1 checklist items (categorical)
- BOTH must pass for completion claims
- `@review` blocking is separate from circuit breaker behavior

### Gate Check Lists

**Pre-Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] spec.md exists and is complete
- [ ] plan.md exists with clear technical approach
- [ ] tasks.md exists with actionable items
- [ ] checklist.md exists (Level 2+)
- [ ] No unresolved P0 blockers

**Post-Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] All tasks marked [x] in tasks.md
- [ ] All P0 checklist items verified with evidence
- [ ] All P1 items complete or deferred with approval
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] implementation-summary.md created

---

## 10. 🔌 CIRCUIT BREAKER

The circuit breaker isolates failing operations to prevent cascading failures.

### States

| State | Condition | Behavior |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| CLOSED | Normal operation | All operations proceed |
| OPEN | 3+ consecutive failures | Operations fail-fast, skip affected step |
| HALF-OPEN | After cooldown (30s) | Single test operation allowed |

### Configuration

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| failure_threshold | 3 | Failures before OPEN state |
| cooldown_seconds | 30 | Time before HALF-OPEN |
| success_to_close | 1 | Successes in HALF-OPEN to return to CLOSED |

### Behavior by Step

- **Steps 1-5**: Circuit breaker active - failures trigger state changes
- **Step 6**: Per-task circuit breaker - isolates failing tasks
- **Step 7**: Critical step - circuit breaker disabled (must complete or fail explicitly)
- **Steps 8-9**: Circuit breaker active - non-critical, can skip on OPEN

### Recovery Actions

When circuit opens:
1. Log failure pattern and affected step
2. Skip to next non-dependent step if possible
3. Report to user with options:
   - A) Retry after cooldown
   - B) Skip affected step
   - C) Abort workflow

**NOTE: @review Agent Blocking vs Circuit Breaker**

These are SEPARATE mechanisms:
- **Circuit breaker**: Handles operational failures (errors, timeouts, crashes)
- **@review blocking**: Handles quality failures (incomplete P0 items)

A workflow can have:
- Circuit CLOSED + @review BLOCKED = Quality issue, not operational issue
- Circuit OPEN + @review PASS = Operational issue, quality was fine
- Both mechanisms must be satisfied for successful completion

---

## 11. 🔀 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM /SPEC_KIT:COMPLETE

- **Requires existing plan** - Won't create spec.md or plan.md
- **Starts at implementation** - Skips specification and planning phases
- **Use case** - Separated planning/implementation, team handoffs, phased delivery

---

## 12. ✅ VALIDATION DURING IMPLEMENTATION

Validation runs automatically to catch issues early.

Key rules for implementation phase:
- **PLACEHOLDER_FILLED** - Replace all `[PLACEHOLDER]` markers
- **PRIORITY_TAGS** - Add P0/P1/P2 to checklist items
- **EVIDENCE_CITED** - Add `[SOURCE:]` citations for claims

---

## 13. 🔍 EXAMPLES

**Example 1: Execute Existing Plan (autonomous)**
```
/spec_kit:implement:auto specs/042-user-auth/
```

**Example 2: With Review (interactive)**
```
/spec_kit:implement:confirm specs/042-user-auth/
```

**Example 3: With Staging Environment**
```
/spec_kit:implement "specs/042-user-auth/" staging: https://staging.example.com
```

---

## 14. 🔗 COMMAND CHAIN

This command is part of the SpecKit workflow:

```
[/spec_kit:plan] → /spec_kit:implement → [/spec_kit:handover]
```

**Prerequisite:**
← `/spec_kit:plan [feature-description]` (creates spec.md, plan.md)

---

## 15. 📌 NEXT STEPS

After implementation completes, suggest relevant next steps:

| Condition | Suggested Command | Reason |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Implementation complete | Verify in browser | Test functionality works |
| Need to save progress | `/memory:save [spec-folder-path]` | Preserve implementation context |
| Ending session | `/spec_kit:handover [spec-folder-path]` | Create continuation document |
| Found bugs during testing | `/spec_kit:debug [spec-folder-path]` | Delegate debugging to fresh agent |
| Ready for next feature | `/spec_kit:complete [feature-description]` | Start new workflow |

**ALWAYS** end with: "What would you like to do next?"
