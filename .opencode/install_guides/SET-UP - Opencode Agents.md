# Opencode Agents — Primary & Sub-agents

Comprehensive guide for creating and configuring OpenCode agents. Covers both **primary agents** (main assistants cycled via Tab key) and **subagents** (specialized assistants invoked via @ mention or automatically by primary agents). Includes built-in agents (Build, Plan, General, Explore), custom agent creation with YAML frontmatter, tool permissions, behavioral rules, and the distinction between agents (authority + tools) and skills (knowledge + workflows).

Agents are the execution layer of the OpenCode system. Each agent is a specialized persona with specific capabilities, tool access, and behavioral constraints. Unlike skills (which provide knowledge and workflows), agents have **authority** to act and **tools** to execute.

The agent system enables both focused single-agent work and complex multi-agent orchestration with parallel delegation.

## 🤖 AI SET-UP GUIDE

### ⛔ HARD BLOCK: Write Agent Required

> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Agent creation REQUIRES the `@write` agent to be active.

**Why @write is mandatory:**
- Loads `agent_template.md` BEFORE creating (template-first workflow)
- Validates frontmatter format (YAML syntax, required fields)
- Ensures proper tool permissions and behavioral rules
- Invokes `workflows-documentation` skill for documentation standards
- Validates template alignment AFTER creating

**Template Location:** `.opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/assets/opencode/agent_template.md`

**Verification (MUST pass before proceeding):**
- [ ] Write agent exists: `ls .opencode/agent/write.md`
- [ ] Agent template exists: `ls .opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/assets/opencode/agent_template.md`
- [ ] Use `@write` prefix when invoking the prompt below

**❌ DO NOT** create agents without the @write agent — manual creation bypasses quality gates and frontmatter validation.

**Reference:** `.opencode/agent/write.md` → Documentation creation standards

---

**Copy and paste this prompt for interactive agent creation:**

```text
@write I want to create a new agent for OpenCode. Please guide me through the process interactively by asking me questions one at a time.

**PREREQUISITE CHECK (you MUST verify before proceeding):**
- [ ] You are operating as the @write agent
- [ ] workflows-documentation skill is accessible

⚠️ If you are NOT the @write agent: STOP immediately and instruct the user to restart with the "@write" prefix. Do NOT proceed with agent creation.

**Questions to ask me (one at a time, wait for my answer):**

1. **Purpose**: What is the agent's purpose? What specific role will it fill?
   (e.g., "Code review specialist", "Security auditor", "Test automation")

2. **Authority**: What is this agent responsible for? What decisions can it make?
   (e.g., "Approve/reject code changes", "Flag security issues", "Generate test cases")

3. **Tool Permissions**: What tools will the agent need access to?
   - read: Examine files
   - write: Create files
   - edit: Modify files
   - bash: Run commands
   - grep: Search content
   - glob: Find files
   - webfetch: Fetch URLs
   - narsil: Semantic + structural code analysis
   - memory: Spec Kit Memory
   - chrome_devtools: Browser debugging
   - task: Delegate to sub-agents (orchestrator only)

4. **Behavioral Rules**: What should this agent ALWAYS do? NEVER do?
   (e.g., "ALWAYS run tests before approving", "NEVER modify production files")

5. **Skills Integration**: What skills should this agent invoke?
   (e.g., "workflows-code for code standards", "system-spec-kit for documentation")

6. **Agent Name**: What should we name this agent?
   (Format: lowercase, single word or hyphenated, e.g., "review", "security-audit")

**After gathering my answers, please:**

1. Create the agent file at `.opencode/agent/<agent-name>.md`
2. Generate proper YAML frontmatter with:
   - name, description, mode, temperature
   - tools (true/false for each)
   - permission (allow/deny for actions)
3. Create the agent body with:
   - Core workflow section
   - Domain-specific sections
   - Anti-patterns section
   - Related resources section
4. Validate the frontmatter syntax
5. Help me test the agent with a real example
6. Iterate and refine based on testing

My project is at: [your project path]
```

**What the AI will do:**
- Ask questions one at a time to understand your agent requirements
- Create the agent file with proper frontmatter structure
- Generate behavioral rules based on your answers
- Set appropriate tool permissions
- Guide you through testing with real examples

**Expected creation time:** 15-25 minutes

## 1. 📖 OVERVIEW

### What Are Agents?

Agents are specialized AI personas defined in markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Each agent has:

- **Identity**: Name and description
- **Authority**: What they're responsible for
- **Tools**: Which tools they can use (read, write, bash, etc.)
- **Permissions**: What actions are allowed/denied
- **Behavior**: Rules and workflows they follow

Think of agents as **roles** with specific job descriptions, while skills are **knowledge bases** they can consult.

### Agent Types

OpenCode has **two types** of agents:

| Type            | Description                                                                 | Invocation                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary**     | Main assistants you interact with directly. Handle main conversation.       | **Tab** key to cycle, or configured keybind     |
| **Subagent**    | Specialized assistants for specific tasks. Invoked by primary agents or manually. | **@ mention** (e.g., `@general`) or automatic |

**Primary agents** are cycled through using the **Tab** key during a session. They have full access to configured tools and handle your main conversation.

**Subagents** are specialized assistants that:
- Can be invoked **automatically** by primary agents based on their descriptions
- Can be invoked **manually** by @ mentioning them (e.g., `@general help me search`)
- Create child sessions that you can navigate using `<Leader>+Right/Left`

### Built-in Agents (OpenCode Default)

OpenCode comes with **4 built-in agents** (2 primary + 2 subagents):

| Agent       | Mode       | Purpose                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Build**   | `primary`  | Default agent with all tools enabled for development work  |
| **Plan**    | `primary`  | Restricted agent for analysis/planning without changes     |
| **General** | `subagent` | General-purpose for research and multi-step tasks          |
| **Explore** | `subagent` | Fast agent for codebase exploration and file searching     |

### Key Statistics

## 2. 🚀 QUICK START

### Using Primary Agents

Primary agents are cycled using the **Tab** key during a session:

```markdown
# Press Tab to switch between primary agents
<Tab> → Build (default, all tools)
<Tab> → Plan (analysis only, no changes)
<Tab> → Build (cycles back)

# You'll see the current agent indicated in the lower right corner
```

### Using Subagents

Subagents are invoked via **@ mention** or automatically by primary agents:

```markdown
# Manual invocation with @ mention
"@general help me search for this function"
"@explore find all files matching *.config.ts"

# Automatic invocation (primary agent decides based on task)
"Search the codebase for authentication patterns"
→ Primary agent may invoke @explore automatically
```

### Session Navigation

When subagents create child sessions, navigate between them:

| Keybind              | Action                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `<Leader>+Right`     | Cycle forward: parent → child1 → child2   |
| `<Leader>+Left`      | Cycle backward: parent ← child1 ← child2  |

### Verify Agents Are Available

```bash
# List custom agent files
ls .opencode/agent/

# Expected output:
# debug.md
# handover.md
# orchestrate.md
# research.md
# review.md
# speckit.md
# write.md

# Built-in agents (Build, Plan, General, Explore) are always available
```

### First Use

1. **For development work**: Use **Build** agent (default) - has all tools enabled

2. **For planning/analysis**: Press **Tab** to switch to **Plan** agent - suggests changes without making them

3. **For codebase exploration**: Type `@explore` to invoke the fast exploration subagent

4. **For research tasks**: Type `@general` for general purposes, or `@research` for structured 9-step technical investigation

5. **For documentation tasks**: Type `@write` to invoke the custom documentation agent

6. **For complex multi-step tasks**: Type `@orchestrate` to decompose and delegate work

7. **For code reviews**: Type `@review` for quality scoring and security assessment

8. **For spec folder creation**: Type `@speckit` to create Level 1-3+ spec documentation

9. **For session handover**: Type `@handover` or use `/spec_kit:handover` to preserve context

10. **For stuck debugging**: Type `@debug` for fresh perspective with 4-phase methodology

## 5. ⚙️ AGENT ANATOMY

### Frontmatter Fields (v1.1.1+ Format)

Every agent file MUST have YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name                    # Required: Identifier
description: One-line description   # Required: Purpose
mode: primary                       # Required: primary or secondary
temperature: 0.1                    # Required: 0.0-1.0 (lower = deterministic)
permission:                         # Required: Unified permissions (v1.1.1+)
  read: allow
  write: allow
  edit: allow
  bash: allow
  grep: allow
  glob: allow
  webfetch: deny
  narsil: allow
  memory: allow
  chrome_devtools: deny
  external_directory: allow
---
```

> **Note:** The separate `tools:` object is deprecated as of OpenCode v1.1.1. Use the unified `permission:` object with `allow`/`deny`/`ask` values instead. The old format still works for backwards compatibility.

## 6. 🔧 CREATING NEW AGENTS

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Identify the Need

Ask yourself:
- Does this task require specific tool permissions?
- Does this task have unique behavioral rules?
- Would a skill be sufficient, or is agent authority needed?

If you need **authority + tools + rules** → Create an agent.
If you need **knowledge + workflows** → Create a skill.

#### Step 2: Create the File

**Option A: Interactive Command (Recommended)**

```bash
# Use the /create:agent command with @write agent
@write /create:agent my-agent
```

This interactive command will:
1. Verify @write agent is active (required for template enforcement)
2. Ask for agent type (primary/subagent/all)
3. Confirm output location (project or global)
4. Guide you through understanding (purpose, use cases, authority)
5. Help you plan configuration (tools, permissions, rules)
6. Generate the agent file with proper frontmatter
7. Validate YAML syntax before completion

**Option B: OpenCode CLI (Alternative)**

```bash
# Use OpenCode's built-in agent creation wizard
opencode agent create
```

This CLI command will:
1. Ask where to save the agent (global or project-specific)
2. Ask for a description of what the agent should do
3. Generate an appropriate system prompt and identifier
4. Let you select which tools the agent can access
5. Create a markdown file with the agent configuration

**Option C: Manual Creation**

```bash
# Create agent file manually
touch .opencode/agent/my-agent.md
```

This interactive command will:
1. Ask where to save the agent (global or project-specific)
2. Ask for a description of what the agent should do
3. Generate an appropriate system prompt and identifier
4. Let you select which tools the agent can access
5. Create a markdown file with the agent configuration

**Option B: Manual Creation**

```bash
# Create agent file manually
touch .opencode/agent/my-agent.md
```

#### Step 3: Add Frontmatter (v1.1.1+ Format)

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
description: One-line description of what this agent does
mode: subagent  # Options: primary, subagent, or all (default)
temperature: 0.1
permission:
  read: allow
  write: allow
  edit: allow
  bash: allow
  grep: allow
  glob: allow
  webfetch: deny
  narsil: allow
  memory: allow
  chrome_devtools: deny
  external_directory: allow
---
```

**Mode Selection Guide:**

| Choose `mode`  | When...                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primary`      | Agent should appear in Tab cycle as main assistant             |
| `subagent`     | Agent should only be invoked via @ mention or by other agents  |
| `all` (default)| Agent can be used both ways                                    |

#### Step 4: Add Content

```markdown
# My Agent Title

Brief description of this agent's purpose and authority.

---

## 1. 🔄 CORE WORKFLOW

1. **STEP 1** → Description
2. **STEP 2** → Description
3. **STEP 3** → Description

## 2. 📋 [DOMAIN SECTION]

### Subsection

❌ **Never do Y**
- Reason

---

## 4. 🔗 RELATED RESOURCES

- [Skill Name](../skill/skill-name/SKILL.md)
- [Template](../skill/workflows-documentation/assets/opencode/agent_template.md)
```

#### Step 5: Test the Agent

```markdown
# Invoke explicitly
@my-agent do something

# Or let OpenCode route automatically based on task type
```

## 7. 🎯 AGENT VS SKILL

### Key Differences

| Aspect           | Agent                         | Skill                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Purpose**      | Persona with authority to act | Knowledge/workflow bundle    |
| **Location**     | `.opencode/agent/`            | `.opencode/skill/`           |
| **Invocation**   | `@agent-name` or automatic    | `skill("name")` or automatic |
| **Has Tools**    | Yes (tool permissions)        | No (uses agent's tools)      |
| **Has Rules**    | Yes (behavioral)              | Yes (domain-specific)        |
| **Scope**        | Broad authority               | Narrow expertise             |
| **Can Delegate** | Yes (orchestrate)             | No                           |
| **Frontmatter**  | name, tools, permission       | name, allowed-tools          |

### When to Use Each

## 9. 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

#### Agent Not Recognized

**Symptom:** `@agent-name` doesn't invoke the agent

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause                        | Solution                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| File not in correct location | Move to `.opencode/agent/`            |
| Invalid frontmatter          | Check YAML syntax                     |
| Missing `name` field         | Add `name: agent-name` to frontmatter |
| OpenCode not restarted       | Restart OpenCode                      |

#### Agent Can't Use Tool

**Symptom:** Agent fails when trying to use a tool

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause                     | Solution                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Permission set to `deny`  | Set `permission.toolname: allow` in frontmatter  |
| Using deprecated format   | Migrate from `tools:` to `permission:` (v1.1.1+) |
| Tool not available        | Check tool exists in OpenCode                    |

#### Agent Not Following Rules

**Symptom:** Agent ignores behavioral rules in its file

**Causes & Solutions:**

| Cause                  | Solution                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Rules not clear enough | Make rules explicit with ALWAYS/NEVER |
| Conflicting rules      | Resolve conflicts, prioritize         |
| Temperature too high   | Lower temperature to 0.1              |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check agent files exist
ls -la .opencode/agent/

# Verify frontmatter syntax
head -30 .opencode/agent/write.md

# Check for YAML errors
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.opencode/agent/write.md').read().split('---')[1])"
```

| **Explore** | Subagent   | Fast codebase exploration                  | `@explore`        |

### Custom Agents (Project-Specific)

| Agent           | Type     | Purpose                                    | Invocation        |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **orchestrate** | Primary  | Task decomposition & delegation            | `@orchestrate`    |
| **write**       | All      | Documentation with template enforcement    | `@write`          |
| **research**    | Subagent | Technical investigation & evidence         | `@research`       |
| **review**      | Subagent | Code quality & security assessment         | `@review`         |
| **speckit**     | Subagent | Spec folder documentation (Level 1-3+)     | `@speckit`        |
| **handover**    | Subagent | Session continuation & context preservation| `@handover`       |
| **debug**       | Subagent | Fresh perspective debugging                | `@debug`          |

### Key Principles

- **Primary agents** are cycled via **Tab** key - use for main conversation
- **Subagents** are invoked via **@ mention** - use for specialized tasks
- **Agents have authority** - They can act using permitted tools
- **Skills have knowledge** - They provide expertise agents can invoke
- **Templates ensure consistency** - All output follows established patterns
- **Quality gates verify output** - DQI scoring, template alignment checks

**Remember:** Use agents for **authority + tools**, use skills for **knowledge + workflows**.
