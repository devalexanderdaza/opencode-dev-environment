## 0. 🤖 AI INSTALL GUIDE

### ⛔ HARD BLOCK: Write Agent Required

> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Skill creation REQUIRES the `@write` agent to be active.

**Why @write is mandatory:**
- Loads `skill_md_template.md` BEFORE creating (template-first workflow)
- Validates template alignment AFTER creating
- Runs DQI scoring (target: 90+ Excellent)
- Invokes `workflows-documentation` skill for standards
- Ensures proper use of `init_skill.py` and `package_skill.py`
- Adheres to all template standards from `workflows-documentation`

**Verification (MUST pass before proceeding):**
- [ ] Write agent exists: `ls .opencode/agent/write.md`
- [ ] Use `@write` prefix when invoking the prompt below

**❌ DO NOT** create skills without the @write agent — manual creation bypasses quality gates and template alignment.

**Reference:** `.opencode/agent/write.md` → Section 4 (Mode 2: Skill Creation)

### 📋 Required Templates (Loaded by @write Agent)

The @write agent MUST load these templates before creating any skill files:

| Template | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **SKILL.md Template** | `.opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/assets/skill_md_template.md` | Main skill file structure |
| **Reference Template** | `.opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/assets/skill_reference_template.md` | Reference file structure |
| **Asset Template** | `.opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/assets/skill_asset_template.md` | Asset file structure |
| **Skill Creation Guide** | `.opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/references/skill_creation.md` | Complete workflow reference |

**Template-First Workflow:**
```
1. LOAD template → 2. CREATE content → 3. VALIDATE alignment → 4. DQI score
```

---

**Copy and paste this prompt for interactive skill creation:**

```text
@write I want to create a new skill for OpenCode. Please guide me through the process interactively by asking me questions one at a time.

**PREREQUISITE CHECK (you MUST verify before proceeding):**
- [ ] You are operating as the @write agent (Mode 2: Skill Creation)
- [ ] workflows-documentation skill is accessible

⚠️ If you are NOT the @write agent: STOP immediately and instruct the user to restart with the "@write" prefix. Do NOT proceed with skill creation.

**Questions to ask me (one at a time, wait for my answer):**

1. **Purpose**: What is the skill's purpose? What problem does it solve?

2. **Use Cases**: Give me 2-3 concrete examples of when this skill would be triggered.
   (e.g., "When user asks to create documentation", "When user needs to debug browser issues")

3. **Required Tools**: What tools will the skill need access to?
   - Read (examine files)
   - Write (create files)
   - Edit (modify files)
   - Bash (run commands)
   - Glob (find files)
   - Grep (search content)
   - Task (delegate to agents)
   - WebFetch (fetch URLs)

4. **Bundled Resources**: Will the skill need bundled resources?
   - scripts/ (Python/bash automation)
   - references/ (detailed documentation)
   - assets/ (templates, examples)

5. **Skill Name**: What should we name this skill?
   (Format: lowercase-hyphenated, e.g., "my-custom-skill")

**After gathering my answers, please:**

1. Run: `python .opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path .opencode/skill`
2. Help me populate the SKILL.md template with my answers
3. Guide me through creating any bundled resources
4. Run: `python .opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/scripts/package_skill.py .opencode/skill/<skill-name>` to validate
5. Help me test the skill with a real example
6. Iterate and refine based on testing

My project is at: [your project path]
```

**What the AI will do:**
- Ask questions one at a time to understand your skill requirements
- Scaffold the structure using init_skill.py
- Generate SKILL.md based on your answers
- Guide you through adding scripts, references, or assets
- Validate with package_skill.py
- Help you test with real examples

**Expected creation time:** 20-30 minutes

---

## 1. 🚀 QUICK START

**Time estimate: 20-30 minutes**

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize skill structure (~2 min)
python .opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/scripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path .opencode/skill

# Step 2: Edit SKILL.md with your content (~15 min)
# Required: name (must match folder), description
# Recommended: allowed-tools, version
# Required sections: WHEN TO USE, HOW IT WORKS (or HOW TO USE), RULES

# Step 3: Add bundled resources as needed (~5 min)
# scripts/ → automation, references/ → documentation, assets/ → templates

# Step 4: Validate (~1 min)
python .opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/scripts/package_skill.py .opencode/skill/my-skill --check

# Step 5: Package (~1 min)
python .opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/scripts/package_skill.py .opencode/skill/my-skill

# Step 6: Test - restart OpenCode, skill appears as skills_my_skill
```

**Result:** Skill auto-discovered by OpenCode v1.0.190+ as `skills_my_skill()` function.

### Step 1: Understanding (~5 min)

**Goal:** Define the skill's purpose with concrete examples.

**Questions to answer:**

| Question                                      | Purpose              |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| What problem does this skill solve?           | Core value           |
| When would an AI agent need this?             | Trigger conditions   |
| What are 2-3 specific use cases?              | Grounds in reality   |
| What distinguishes this from existing skills? | Prevents duplication |

**Example:**
```markdown
Purpose: Help users create ASCII flowcharts for documentation

Use Cases:
1. "Create a flowchart for user authentication flow"
2. "Visualize this decision tree as ASCII art"
3. "Draw the data flow diagram for the payment system"

Triggers: "flowchart", "diagram", "visualize", "ASCII art"
```

---

### Step 2: Planning (~5 min)

**Goal:** Identify what resources the skill needs.

**Resource Decision Matrix:**

| Need       | Resource Type | When to Include                           |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Automation | `scripts/`    | Repetitive tasks, validation, scaffolding |
| Deep docs  | `references/` | Content > 500 words, API details          |
| Templates  | `assets/`     | Reusable patterns, examples               |
| Data files | `assets/`     | Static data, configurations               |

**Planning Checklist:**
- [ ] Does the skill need automation scripts?
- [ ] Does the skill need detailed documentation?
- [ ] Does the skill need templates or examples?
- [ ] What tools will the skill use? (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task, WebFetch)

---

### Step 3: Initializing (~2 min)

**Goal:** Scaffold the skill structure.

**Command:**
```bash
python .opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path .opencode/skill
```

**Example:**
```bash
python .opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/scripts/init_skill.py my-flowchart-skill --path .opencode/skill
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
Creating skill: my-flowchart-skill
Location: .opencode/skill/my-flowchart-skill/

Created:
  ✓ SKILL.md (template)
  ✓ references/ (directory)
  ✓ scripts/ (directory)
  ✓ assets/ (directory)
```

**Resulting Structure:**
```text
.opencode/skill/my-flowchart-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Main orchestrator (template)
├── references/       # Detailed documentation
├── scripts/          # Automation scripts
└── assets/           # Templates and examples
```

---

### Step 4: Editing (~10-15 min)

**Goal:** Populate the templates with skill-specific content.

**Edit Order:**
1. **SKILL.md** - Main orchestrator (required)
2. **scripts/** - Automation if needed
3. **references/** - Deep documentation if needed
4. **assets/** - Templates and examples if needed

**SKILL.md Editing Checklist:**

**Frontmatter (Required):**
- [ ] `name` - hyphen-case, matches folder name exactly
- [ ] `description` - single-line, no `<>` characters

**Frontmatter (Recommended):**
- [ ] `allowed-tools` - array format `[Read, Write, Edit]`
- [ ] `version` - semantic versioning

**Required Sections:**
- [ ] WHEN TO USE - trigger conditions and use cases
- [ ] HOW IT WORKS or HOW TO USE - step-by-step execution patterns
- [ ] RULES with subsections: ✅ ALWAYS, ❌ NEVER, ⚠️ ESCALATE IF

**Recommended Sections:**
- [ ] SMART ROUTING - resource router tables
- [ ] SUCCESS CRITERIA - completion checklists
- [ ] INTEGRATION POINTS - related skills

See [Section 4: SKILL.md Reference](#4--skillmd-reference) for the canonical template.

---

### Step 5: Packaging (~2 min)

**Goal:** Validate the skill meets all requirements.

**Quick Validation (check mode):**
```bash
python .opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/scripts/package_skill.py .opencode/skill/my-skill --check
```

**Full Packaging:**
```bash
python .opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/scripts/package_skill.py .opencode/skill/my-skill
```

**Expected Output (Success):**
```text
Validating skill: my-skill

Checks:
  ✓ YAML frontmatter valid
  ✓ Required fields present (name, description)
  ✓ Name matches folder (hyphen-case)
  ✓ Description is single-line, no <> characters
  ✓ Required sections present (WHEN TO USE, HOW IT WORKS/HOW TO USE, RULES)
  ✓ RULES section has ALWAYS/NEVER/ESCALATE subsections
  ✓ Word count under 5k (current: 2,341)

Validation: PASSED
DQI Score: 82/100 (Good)
```

**Expected Output (Failure):**
```text
Validating skill: my-skill

Checks:
  ✓ YAML frontmatter valid
  ✗ Name not hyphen-case or doesn't match folder
  ✗ Missing required section: HOW IT WORKS

Validation: FAILED
Fix the errors above and re-run validation.
```

---

### Step 6: Iterating (ongoing)

**Goal:** Test the skill with real use cases and refine.

**Testing Process:**

1. **Restart OpenCode** - Required for discovery rescan
2. **Verify skill appears** - Check for `skills_my_skill` in available tools
3. **Try each use case** - Test with real requests
4. **Document issues** - What was unclear? What was missing?
5. **Refine and re-validate** - Fix issues and run package_skill.py again

**Iteration Checklist:**
- [ ] Skill invokes correctly (native discovery or Read tool)
- [ ] Skill triggers on expected keywords
- [ ] Instructions are clear and actionable
- [ ] Scripts execute without errors
- [ ] Resources are accessible and helpful
- [ ] Use cases produce expected results

---

## 4. 📝 SKILL.MD REFERENCE

> **CRITICAL:** The `name` field in frontmatter **MUST match the folder name exactly** (case-sensitive, hyphen-case). This is the #1 cause of discovery failures.

## 5. 📦 BUNDLED RESOURCES

### When to Create Each Type

| Type            | Create When                                                      | Examples                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **scripts/**    | Same code rewritten repeatedly, deterministic reliability needed | `validate.py`, `init.sh`    |
| **references/** | Documentation > 500 words, API specs, detailed guides            | `workflow.md`, `api.md`     |
| **assets/**     | Templates for output, reusable patterns, examples                | `template.md`, `example.md` |

### scripts/

**Purpose:** Automation scripts for repetitive or complex tasks.

**Naming:** snake_case, extensions `.py`, `.sh`, `.bash`, `.js`

**Python Script Template:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does.

Usage:
    python script_name.py <arg1> [--option]
"""

import argparse

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Script description")
    parser.add_argument("input", help="Input description")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    # Implementation
    print(f"Processing: {args.input}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### references/

**Purpose:** Detailed documentation that doesn't fit in SKILL.md.

**Naming:** snake_case, only `.md` files

**Best Practices:**
- If content exceeds 500 words, move to references/
- Include grep search patterns in SKILL.md for large files
- Avoid duplication between SKILL.md and references

### assets/

**Purpose:** Templates, examples, and data files used in output.

**Naming:** snake_case

**Best Practices:**
- Use `[PLACEHOLDER]` format for replaceable content
- Include usage instructions in template files
- Organize complex assets in subdirectories

### Referencing Resources in SKILL.md

```markdown
## SMART ROUTING

| Resource       | Path                                | Purpose            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Detailed Guide | [guide.md](./references/guide.md)   | Full documentation |
| Template       | [template.md](./assets/template.md) | Starting point     |
| Script         | `scripts/main.py`                   | Automation         |
```

---

## 6. ✅ VALIDATION AND TESTING

### Validation Commands

| Command                    | Purpose                     | When to Use         |

| `package_skill.py --check` | Validation only             | During development  |
| `package_skill.py`         | Full validation + packaging | Before distribution |
| `extract_structure.py`     | DQI scoring                 | Quality assessment  |

### DQI Score Interpretation

| Score  | Rating    | Action                      |
| ------ | --------- | --------------------------- |
| 90-100 | Excellent | Production ready            |
| 75-89  | Good      | Minor improvements          |
| 60-74  | Fair      | Needs work                  |
| <60    | Poor      | Significant revision needed |

**Target: DQI >= 75 (Good)**

### Test Matrix

| Test                 | Command/Action               | Expected Result                      |

## 8. 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Errors and Fixes

**"Skill not found" / Not appearing in tools**

| Cause                      | Fix                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name doesn't match folder  | Ensure `name:` field exactly matches folder name (case-sensitive) |
| Invalid YAML frontmatter   | Check `---` delimiters, use spaces not tabs                       |
| OpenCode not restarted     | Restart OpenCode to trigger discovery scan                        |
| Description has `<>` chars | Remove angle brackets from description                            |

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check frontmatter
head -10 .opencode/skill/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Get folder name
ls -d .opencode/skill/my-skill

# Get frontmatter name
grep "^name:" .opencode/skill/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

## 9. 🔧 DISCOVERY MECHANICS

> This section explains internal mechanics for advanced users. Not required for basic skill creation.

### How Native Discovery Works

OpenCode has built-in skill discovery - **no plugin required**. Skills are auto-discovered from `.opencode/skill/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter.

### Discovery Process

```text
Step 1: STARTUP SCAN
    └─► OpenCode scans .opencode/skill/*/SKILL.md
            ↓
Step 2: FRONTMATTER PARSING
    └─► Extract name, description, allowed-tools from YAML
            ↓
Step 3: FUNCTION REGISTRATION
    └─► Register as skills_<name> function
    └─► Hyphens → underscores (my-skill → skills_my_skill)
            ↓
Step 4: AVAILABILITY
    └─► Skill accessible via:
        - Direct call: skills_my_skill()
        - Read tool: Read(".opencode/skill/my-skill/SKILL.md")
        - Natural language matching description
```

### Discovery Requirements

| Requirement                         | Details                         | Failure Mode                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Valid YAML frontmatter              | Opening and closing `---`       | Skill not found                   |
| `name` field present                | Must match folder name exactly  | Skill not found                   |
| `description` field                 | Single line, no `<>` characters | Parse error                       |
| `allowed-tools` array (recommended) | Bracket format `[Read, Write]`  | Validation warning (non-blocking) |

### Function Naming

```text
Folder: .opencode/skill/mcp-narsil/
    → Function: skills_mcp_narsil()

Folder: .opencode/skill/workflows-code/
    → Function: skills_workflows_code()

Folder: .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/
    → Function: skills_system_spec_kit()
```

### Quick Verification

```bash
# 1. Check frontmatter is valid
head -10 .opencode/skill/my-skill/SKILL.md

# 2. Restart OpenCode (required for discovery rescan)

# 3. Skill appears as skills_my_skill in available tools
```

## 12. 🔗 POST-CREATION: SKILL ADVISOR SETUP

After creating a skill, you must configure the **Skill Advisor** so AI agents can automatically route tasks to your new skill.

### Why This Step Matters

The Skill Advisor (`skill_advisor.py`) is the routing system that matches user requests to skills. Without adding your skill to the advisor, AI agents won't know when to invoke it.

### Quick Setup

**Full guide:** [SET-UP - Skill Advisor.md](./SET-UP%20-%20Skill%20Advisor.md)

**Quick steps:**

1. **Open the skill advisor script:**
   ```bash
   code .opencode/scripts/skill_advisor.py
   ```

2. **Add your skill to the `SKILLS` dictionary:**
   ```python
   SKILLS = {
       # ... existing skills ...
       "my-new-skill": {
           "triggers": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "use case phrase"],
           "description": "Brief description matching SKILL.md",
           "path": ".opencode/skill/my-new-skill/SKILL.md"
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Test the routing:**
   ```bash
   python3 .opencode/scripts/skill_advisor.py "your trigger phrase"
   ```

4. **Verify confidence > 0.8** for your intended triggers

### Trigger Keyword Best Practices

| Good Triggers | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Specific verbs | "create flowchart", "generate diagram" |
| Domain terms | "ASCII art", "decision tree" |
| Use case phrases | "visualize workflow" |

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Generic words | "help", "create", "make" (too broad) |
| Single letters | Low specificity |
| Common phrases | May conflict with other skills |

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Skill added to `SKILLS` dictionary in `skill_advisor.py`
- [ ] Triggers are specific and unique
- [ ] Description matches SKILL.md description
- [ ] Path is correct and file exists
- [ ] Test returns confidence > 0.8 for intended triggers

**Skill Creation Complete!**

Your skill is now ready. OpenCode v1.0.190+ will auto-discover it from `.opencode/skill/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter. Skills appear as `skills_*` functions in available tools.
