### Key Features

- **Dynamic Thought Sequences**: Adjust the number of thoughts as needed during analysis
- **Branching Exploration**: Explore alternative approaches from any thought point
- **Revision Support**: Reconsider and revise previous thoughts when new insights emerge
- **Flexible Structure**: No predefined stages - adapt the thinking process to your problem
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your position in the thought sequence
- **Zero Installation**: Runs via npx - no manual installation required

### How It Works

```
Start Thinking → Record Thought 1 → Record Thought 2 → ... → Final Conclusion
                      ↓                    ↓
                 [Revise if needed]   [Branch to explore alternatives]
```

The tool supports:
- **Linear progression**: Move through thoughts sequentially
- **Revisions**: Go back and reconsider earlier assumptions
- **Branching**: Explore multiple solution paths simultaneously
- **Dynamic adjustment**: Increase or decrease total thoughts as needed

## 8. 💡 EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Basic Analysis

```typescript
// Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Analyzing the authentication flow. Current implementation uses JWT tokens stored in localStorage, which has XSS vulnerability concerns.",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 2
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Alternative approaches: 1) HttpOnly cookies (better security), 2) Session tokens (stateful), 3) Token rotation (complexity trade-off).",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 3
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "HttpOnly cookies provide XSS protection with minimal implementation changes. Need to handle CSRF separately.",
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 4 - Conclusion
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Recommendation: Migrate to HttpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict. Add CSRF token for state-changing requests. Implementation effort: ~4 hours.",
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: false
})
```

### Example 2: With Revision

```typescript
// Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Initial assumption: The performance issue is in the database query.",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 2
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Query profiling shows 50ms response time - actually quite fast.",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 3 - Revising Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Revising my earlier assumption: The bottleneck is NOT in the database. Looking at network waterfall, the issue is N+1 API calls from the frontend.",
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  isRevision: true,
  revisesThought: 1,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Continue with corrected understanding...
```

### Example 3: With Branching

```typescript
// Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Need to choose between microservices and monolith for the new e-commerce platform.",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 2 - Branch A: Microservices
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Branch A - Microservices: Better scalability, independent deployments. But: Team of 5 developers, 3-month timeline. Risk of over-engineering.",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  branchFromThought: 1,
  branchId: "microservices",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 3 - Branch B: Monolith
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Branch B - Monolith: Faster initial development, simpler deployment. Can extract services later when team/scale grows.",
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  branchFromThought: 1,
  branchId: "monolith",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 4 - Compare branches and conclude
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Comparing branches: Given team size and timeline, monolith wins. Can adopt 'modular monolith' pattern for future extraction.",
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})
```
