# Level Decision Matrix - Quick Reference for Documentation Level Selection

> Quick reference for selecting the appropriate documentation level using the progressive enhancement model.

## 1. 📊 DECISION MATRIX TABLE (Progressive Enhancement)

| Level               | LOC Guidance | Required Files                     | Adds To Previous        | Use When                             |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **1: Baseline**     | <100         | `spec.md` + `plan.md` + `tasks.md` | (foundation)            | All features - minimum documentation |
| **2: Verification** | 100-499      | Level 1 + `checklist.md`           | QA checklist            | Needs systematic validation          |
| **3: Full**         | ≥500         | Level 2 + `decision-record.md`     | ADR + optional research | Complex/architectural changes        |

**Progressive Enhancement Model:**
```
Level 1 (Baseline):     spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md
                              ↓
Level 2 (Verification): Level 1 + checklist.md
                              ↓
Level 3 (Full):         Level 2 + decision-record.md + optional research-spike.md
```

## 2. 🎯 LOC AS SOFT GUIDANCE (Not Enforcement)

**How to count:**
- Count all files being modified
- Include new files being created
- Estimate conservatively (round up when uncertain)

**LOC thresholds suggest (not enforce):**
- **<100 LOC** → Suggests Level 1 (Baseline)
- **100-499 LOC** → Suggests Level 2 (Verification)
- **≥500 LOC** → Suggests Level 3 (Full)

**Key distinction:**
- LOC thresholds are **SOFT GUIDANCE** - use judgment
- **Enforcement is MANUAL** - verify required templates exist before claiming completion
- Risk/complexity can override LOC (e.g., 50 LOC security change = Level 2+)

**Note:** Single typo/whitespace fixes (<5 characters in one file) are exempt from spec requirements.

---

## 3. ⚖️ SECONDARY FACTORS (CAN OVERRIDE LOC)

These factors can push you to a higher level even if LOC suggests lower:

### 1. Complexity
- **Simple refactor** (no new logic) → May stay at lower level
- **Architectural change** (new patterns) → Escalate to higher level
- **Example**: 200 LOC refactor might stay Level 2, but 200 LOC architectural change could be Level 3

### 2. Risk
- **Config cascades** → Higher level (documentation protects against mistakes)
- **Authentication/security changes** → Higher level (security implications)
- **Example**: 50 LOC config change affecting multiple systems → Level 2 (risk trumps LOC)

### 3. Dependencies
- **Single component** → Lower level acceptable
- **Multiple systems affected** → Higher level needed
- **Example**: 80 LOC touching 5 different modules → Level 2 (coordination needed)

### 4. Testing Needs
- **Unit tests only** → Lower level acceptable
- **Integration/E2E tests required** → Higher level needed
- **Example**: 95 LOC requiring complex integration testing → Level 2 (testing strategy needed)

## 4. ⚠️ EDGE CASE GUIDANCE

| Scenario                | LOC | Suggested Level | Required Files                  | Rationale                                |
| ----------------------- | --- | --------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Typo in one file        | 1   | Exempt          | None                            | Truly trivial (<5 chars, single file)    |
| Typo across 5 files     | 5   | Level 1         | spec + plan + tasks             | Multi-file coordination                  |
| 95 LOC feature          | 95  | Level 1         | spec + plan + tasks             | Under threshold, baseline docs           |
| 105 LOC feature         | 105 | Level 2         | L1 + checklist                  | Just over, needs QA validation           |
| Refactor (no new logic) | 200 | Level 2         | L1 + checklist                  | Complexity needs verification            |
| Config cascade          | 50  | Level 2         | L1 + checklist                  | Risk trumps LOC - needs validation       |
| Authentication change   | 80  | Level 2         | L1 + checklist                  | Security implications require QA         |
| System redesign         | 300 | Level 3         | L2 + decision-record            | Architectural decisions must be recorded |
| Multi-team project      | 400 | Level 3         | L2 + decision-record + research | Coordination needs full documentation    |

## 5. 🤔 WHEN IN DOUBT

**Choose the higher level.**

**Reasoning:**
- Better to over-document than under-document
- Higher level provides more structure and guidance
- Easier to skip optional sections than add missing documentation later
- Future you will thank present you for the extra context

## 5.1 📚 RESEARCH VS SPIKE TEMPLATES

**When to use which:**

| Template              | Use When                                                                   | Time Investment | Output                           |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **research.md**       | Deep technical investigation spanning multiple areas BEFORE implementation | 1-2 days        | Comprehensive findings document  |
| **research-spike.md** | Time-boxed experimentation to answer specific technical questions          | 1-3 hours       | Go/no-go decision with rationale |

**Decision logic:**
- **Need to explore multiple approaches?** → Use spike (compare options quickly)
- **Need deep understanding of unfamiliar area?** → Use research (thorough investigation)
- **Feasibility unknown?** → Use spike (quick validation)
- **Complex feature requiring architecture decisions?** → Use research first, then spike for unknowns

## 6. 🔄 LEVEL MIGRATION DURING IMPLEMENTATION

If scope grows during implementation, escalate by adding the required files:

| From Level | To Level                   | Action                                                | Files to Add |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1 → 2      | Add verification           | `checklist.md`                                        |
| 2 → 3      | Add decision documentation | `decision-record.md` (+ optional `research-spike.md`) |

**Changelog example:**
```markdown
## Change Log
- 2025-11-15: Created as Level 1 (simple bug fix) - spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
- 2025-11-16: Escalated to Level 2 (discovered validation needs) - added checklist.md
- 2025-11-17: Escalated to Level 3 (architectural decision required) - added decision-record.md
```

**Note:** Going down levels is rare (keep higher-level docs even if not all used).

## 7. 🚀 QUICK DECISION FLOWCHART

```
Any file modification?
    ↓
Single typo? ──YES──→ Exempt (no spec needed)
(<5 chars, 1 file)
    │
    NO
    ↓
Start with Level 1 (Baseline)
Required: spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md
    ↓
Needs QA validation? ──YES──→ Level 2 (add checklist.md)
(risk, multi-file, testing)
    │
    NO (stay Level 1)
    ↓
Architectural decision? ──YES──→ Level 3 (add decision-record.md)
(complex, arch impact)
    │
    NO (stay current level)
```

**LOC as soft guidance (suggests level):**
- <100 LOC → Suggests Level 1
- 100-499 LOC → Suggests Level 2
- ≥500 LOC → Suggests Level 3

**Override factors (can bump level):**
- High complexity? → Consider higher level
- High risk? → Consider higher level
- Multiple dependencies? → Consider higher level
- Complex testing needs? → Consider higher level

**Final check:** If confidence < 80% on level choice → Ask user or choose higher level.
