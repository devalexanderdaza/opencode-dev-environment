## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

### AI Self-Verification Requirement

**This checklist is an ACTIVE VERIFICATION TOOL, not passive documentation.**

When this checklist exists (Level 2+), the AI MUST:

1. **Load** this checklist before claiming any completion
2. **Verify** each item systematically, starting with P0 items
3. **Mark** items `[x]` with evidence when verified
4. **Block** completion claims until all P0/P1 items are verified
5. **Document** any deferred P2 items with reasons

### Priority Enforcement

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0] Critical** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1] High** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval to defer |
| **[P2] Medium** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

### Evidence Format

When marking items complete, include evidence:

```markdown
- [x] CHK001 [P0] Requirements documented | Evidence: [spec.md](./spec.md) sections 1-4
- [x] CHK006 [P0] Code passes lint | Evidence: `npm run lint` output: 0 errors
- [x] CHK011 [P0] Acceptance criteria met | Evidence: [test results](./test-output.md)
- [ ] CHK025 [P2] Performance benchmarks | Deferred: Post-MVP scope per user approval
```

### Verification Summary

At completion, document verification status:

```markdown
## Verification Summary
- **Total Items**: 35
- **Verified [x]**: 32
- **P0 Status**: 12/12 COMPLETE
- **P1 Status**: 15/15 COMPLETE
- **P2 Deferred**: 3 items (see details below)
- **Verification Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

## 4. USAGE NOTES

### Checking Items Off
- Mark completed items: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline
- Link to relevant resources or documentation

### Priority Tags
- **[P0]**: Critical - blocks launch/deployment
- **[P1]**: High - needed for quality but not blocking
- **[P2]**: Medium - nice to have, can be deferred

### Optional Fields
- **Owner**: [Name] - Who is responsible for this item
- **Evidence**: [Link] - Link to proof of completion (test results, PR, etc.)
- **Status**: [Done | Blocked | In Progress] - Current status

### Example With Optional Fields
```markdown
- [x] CHK001 [P0] Requirements documented | Owner: Alice | Evidence: [PR#123](link) | Status: Done
```

### Numbering
- Use CHK### format for easy reference
- Items numbered sequentially for traceability
- Keep numbering consistent when exporting or sharing

### Organization Tips
- Group related items by category
- Split large lists by theme or phase
- Add category headers as needed
- Consider separate checklists for major milestones

## WHEN TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

**Use checklist.md when:**
- Need systematic validation of feature completion
- Multiple quality gates or review stages required
- Pre-deployment verification checklist needed
- QA testing requires structured validation steps
- Security or performance review requires documented checks
- Team needs shared checklist for consistent validation

**Never skip checklist.md for Level 2+:**
- checklist.md is REQUIRED for Level 2 (Verification) and Level 3 (Full)
- For Level 1 (Baseline), checklist.md is optional
- Even simple features benefit from documented validation criteria
- Use a minimal checklist for straightforward features

**Common checklist types:**
- **Pre-Implementation**: Readiness checks before starting work
- **Testing & QA**: Validation during/after implementation
- **Security Review**: Security-specific validation points
- **Performance Review**: Performance benchmarks and targets
- **Pre-Deployment**: Final checks before production release

**Related templates:**
- Use after tasks.md to track completion validation
- Reference spec.md for acceptance criteria
- Reference plan.md for quality gates and success metrics
- Create separate checklists for different review stages
