## 3. USERS & STORIES

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP that delivers value.

  User Story Prioritization Guide:
  - P0: Critical path, blocks launch - must have for any release
  - P1: Core functionality, needed for MVP - essential for usable product
  - P2: Important but not blocking - enhances experience but not required for launch
  - P3: Nice to have, can be deferred - future enhancement

  Independent Testing Principle:
  Each story should be testable in isolation and provide standalone value.
  If you implement ONLY Story 1, you should have something useful.
  If you then add Story 2, it should enhance but not depend on Story 1's internals.
-->

### User Story 1 - [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Brief descriptive title] (Priority: P0/P1/P2/P3)

[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Describe this user journey in plain language - what the user wants to accomplish and why]

[example: As a user, I need to view my daily usage metrics so that I can monitor my consumption patterns]

**Why This Priority**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Explain the value this delivers and justify the priority level]

[example: P0 because viewing metrics is the core value proposition - without it, the feature provides no value]

**Independent Test**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Describe how this story can be tested independently and what standalone value it provides]

[example: Can be fully tested by displaying metrics dashboard with sample data. Delivers value even without export functionality by providing visibility into usage.]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: initial state], **When** [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: user action], **Then** [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: expected outcome]
2. **Given** [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: initial state], **When** [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: user action], **Then** [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: expected outcome]

[example: **Given** user is logged in, **When** they navigate to metrics page, **Then** they see usage data for the last 30 days]

---

### User Story 2 - [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Brief descriptive title] (Priority: P0/P1/P2/P3)

[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Independent Test**: [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: Describe independent testing approach]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [outcome]

### References

- **Related Specs**: [OPTIONAL: Link to related spec folders - example: specs/042-authentication/]
- **Design Mockups**: [OPTIONAL: Link to Figma/design files]

## 12. WORKING FILES

### File Organization During Development

**Temporary/exploratory files MUST be placed in:**
- `scratch/` - For drafts, prototypes, debug logs, test queries (git-ignored)

**Permanent documentation belongs in:**
- Root of spec folder - spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, etc.
- `memory/` - Session context and conversation history

**Anti-pattern - DO NOT:**
- Place temporary files (debug-*.md, test-*.js, scratch-*.json) in project root
- Place disposable content in spec folder root (use scratch/ instead)

### Decision Flow
```
Is this content disposable after the task?
  YES → scratch/
  NO  → Will future sessions need this context?
          YES → memory/
          NO  → spec folder (permanent docs)
```

> **OpenCode Users:** Verify file placement manually before claiming completion.
> See checklist items CHK036-038.

## WHEN TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

Use `spec.md` when:

- ✅ Feature requires clear requirements and user stories (Level 1+)
- ✅ Multiple stakeholders need alignment on scope and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Complexity requires formal requirements documentation
- ✅ Traceability between user stories and requirements is important

For more complex features:
- **Level 2+**: Use spec.md (this template) + `plan.md`
- **Level 3**: Full SpecKit with additional templates (tasks, research, ADRs, etc.)

---

## RELATED DOCUMENTS

- **Implementation Plan**: See `plan.md` for technical approach and architecture
