## 2. CONTEXT

### Problem Statement
[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: what is the technical problem we are trying to solve? What forces are at play? Example: Need to choose authentication mechanism for API that supports both web and mobile clients with different security requirements]

### Current Situation
[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: describe the current state - what exists today that we're changing or building upon] [OPTIONAL: N/A if greenfield]

### Constraints
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: technical constraint 1 - example: Must support iOS 14+ and Android 10+]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: technical constraint 2 - example: Backend team only familiar with Node.js]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: business constraint 1 - example: Must launch within 6 weeks]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: time/resource constraint - example: Single backend developer available]

### Assumptions
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: assumption 1 about environment/platform - example: Users will have stable internet connection]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: assumption 2 about users/usage - example: Peak load will be <1000 concurrent users]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: assumption 3 about future needs - example: Will need to add SSO within 6 months]

## 3. DECISION

### Summary
[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: one-sentence description of the decision made - example: We will use JWT tokens with refresh token rotation for API authentication]

### Detailed Description
[YOUR_VALUE_HERE: comprehensive description including:
- What will be implemented
- How it will be implemented
- Why this approach was chosen
- What changes from the current state

Example: Implement JWT-based authentication where access tokens expire after 15 minutes and refresh tokens expire after 7 days. Tokens will be stored in httpOnly cookies for web clients and secure storage for mobile clients. The auth service will handle token generation, validation, and rotation.]

### Technical Approach
```[language]
[Code example, architecture diagram, or technical specification]

Example:
POST /auth/login → Returns access token + refresh token
GET /api/* → Requires valid access token in Authorization header
POST /auth/refresh → Exchanges refresh token for new access + refresh tokens
```

## 5. CONSEQUENCES

### Positive Consequences
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: positive outcome 1 - example: Stateless auth scales horizontally without coordination]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: positive outcome 2 - example: Mobile clients can cache tokens for offline validation]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: positive outcome 3 - example: Standard JWT libraries available for all platforms]

### Negative Consequences
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: negative outcome 1 + mitigation strategy - example: Tokens cannot be instantly revoked - mitigate with short expiration times]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: negative outcome 2 + mitigation strategy - example: Token size larger than session ID - acceptable trade-off for stateless benefits]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: negative outcome 3 + mitigation strategy]

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How to mitigate] |
| [Risk 2] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How to mitigate] |

### Technical Debt Introduced
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: technical debt item 1 + plan to address - example: Manual token rotation code - plan to migrate to OAuth2 library in 6 months]
- [YOUR_VALUE_HERE: technical debt item 2 + plan to address]
