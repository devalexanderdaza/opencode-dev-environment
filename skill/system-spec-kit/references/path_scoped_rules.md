# Path-Scoped Rules

> **STATUS: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**
> This document describes a FUTURE capability for context-aware rule enforcement.
> Currently, rules are applied uniformly. This serves as a design document.

---

## 1. 📖 Overview

Path-scoped rules would enable differentiated enforcement based on:
- File location (scratch/, memory/, templates/)
- Documentation level (1/2/3)
- File type (spec.md, decision-record.md, etc.)

### Why This Matters

| Scenario                | Without Scoping        | With Scoping                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| scratch/ prototypes     | Full validation blocks | Minimal validation             |
| Level 3 decision record | Same as notes          | ADR-specific checks            |
| Template files          | Placeholder errors     | Exempt from content validation |

## 2. 🏗️ Proposed Rule Hierarchy

```
GLOBAL RULES (always apply)
    ↓
LEVEL RULES (by documentation level)
    ↓
PATH RULES (by file pattern)
    ↓
OVERRIDE RULES (explicit exemptions)
```

## 3. 📂 Proposed Path Patterns

### By Directory

| Pattern                                         | Proposed Behavior            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `**/scratch/**`                                 | Skip all validation          |
| `**/memory/**`                                  | Minimal validation           |
| `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/**` | Skip content validation      |
| `specs/*/spec.md`                               | Level-appropriate validation |

### By Level

| Level | Proposed Checks                                |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Basic placeholder check, core sections         |
| 2     | + Priority tags required, verification items   |
| 3     | + Alternatives analysis, methodology, evidence |

## 4. 🔧 Current Workarounds

Until implemented, use:

**Manual selection:**
```markdown
<!-- Agent instruction -->
When editing scratch/ files, skip validation.
```

**Environment variable:**
```bash
SPECKIT_SKIP_VALIDATION=true ./script.sh
```

## 5. 🚀 Future Implementation

When implemented, would support:

1. **Real-time validation** - IDE integration
2. **Rule cascade** - Inherit from parent paths
3. **Custom severity** - Project overrides
4. **Autofix** - Automatic corrections

### Proposed Configuration

```yaml
# Future .speckit.yaml
path_rules:
  enabled: true
  patterns:
    - path: "**/scratch/**"
      rules: none
    - path: "specs/*/decision-record*.md"
      rules: level3_strict
```
