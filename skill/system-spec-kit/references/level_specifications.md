# Level Specifications - Complete Level 1-3 Requirements

> Complete specifications for all three documentation levels using the progressive enhancement model.

**Progressive Enhancement Model:**
```
Level 1 (Baseline):     spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md
                              ↓
Level 2 (Verification): Level 1 + checklist.md
                              ↓
Level 3 (Full):         Level 2 + decision-record.md + optional research.md
```

**Key Points:**
- LOC thresholds are **SOFT GUIDANCE** (not enforcement)
- **Enforcement is MANUAL** - verify required templates exist before claiming completion
- When in doubt, choose higher level

**Note:** Single typo/whitespace fixes (<5 characters in one file) are exempt from spec folder requirements.

---

## 1. 🔵 LEVEL 1: BASELINE DOCUMENTATION (LOC guidance: <100)

### When to Use

- **All features start here** - this is the minimum documentation for any work
- Localized to one component or module
- Includes trivial changes (typos, single-line fixes)
- Clear, well-defined requirements
- Low to moderate complexity

### Required Files (Baseline)

- `spec.md` - Requirements and user stories (copy template from `templates/spec.md`)

### Optional Files

- None (baseline is complete)

### Content Expectations

**spec.md required sections:**
- Problem statement or feature description
- Proposed solution
- Files to change
- Testing approach
- Success criteria

**plan.md required sections:**
- Implementation approach
- File changes breakdown
- Testing strategy

## 4. 🔄 LEVEL MIGRATION

### When Scope Grows During Implementation

If you discover mid-work that scope is larger than anticipated, escalate by adding the required files:

| From  | To                         | Action                                                | Files to Add |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1 → 2 | Add verification           | `checklist.md`                                        |
| 2 → 3 | Add decision documentation | `decision-record.md` (+ optional `research.md`) |

**Changelog example:**

```markdown
## Change Log
- 2025-11-15: Created as Level 1 (simple feature) - spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
- 2025-11-16: Escalated to Level 2 (discovered validation needs) - added checklist.md
- 2025-11-17: Escalated to Level 3 (architectural decision required) - added decision-record.md
```

**Rules:**
- Keep existing documentation (progressive enhancement - don't delete lower-level files)
- Update `level:` field in metadata
- Document reason for escalation
- Inform user of level change and implications

### When to Stay at Current Level

**Don't escalate unnecessarily:**
- Minor scope increase (50 → 95 LOC still Level 1)
- Complexity didn't actually increase (just took longer than expected)
- One additional file doesn't change coordination needs

**Stability preferred:**
- Once started, try to stay at chosen level
- Only escalate if genuinely needed
- Inform user before escalating

---

## 5. 📌 STATUS FIELD CONVENTION

Every spec.md should include a status field to track lifecycle:

```yaml
---
title: Feature Name
created: 2025-11-15
status: active  # ← Add this field
level: 2
---
```

### Valid Status Values

| Status     | Meaning                 | When to Use                        | Reuse Priority              |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `draft`    | Planning phase          | Initial spec creation, not started | 2 (can start)               |
| `active`   | Work in progress        | Currently implementing             | 1 (highest - continue here) |
| `paused`   | Temporarily on hold     | Blocked or deprioritized           | 3 (can resume)              |
| `complete` | Implementation finished | Feature deployed and stable        | 4 (avoid reopening)         |
| `archived` | Historical record       | Deprecated or superseded           | 5 (do not reuse)            |

### Status Lifecycle

```
draft → active → complete → archived
   ↓       ↓
paused  paused
   ↓
active (resume)
```

**Update status as work progresses:**
- Create spec → `draft`
- Start implementation → `active`
- Blocked/paused → `paused`
- Deployment complete → `complete`
- Feature deprecated → `archived`

---

## 6. 🔀 RELATED SPECS: UPDATE VS CREATE

### When to UPDATE Existing Spec

Update an existing spec folder when:

✅ **Iterative development** - Continuing work on same feature across sessions
- Example: Initial implementation → bug fixes → enhancements

✅ **Bug fixes** - Fixing issues in existing implementation
- Example: "Fix alignment bug in markdown-c7-optimizer" → Update markdown-c7-optimizer spec

✅ **Scope escalation** - Work grows beyond original estimate
- Example: Level 1 bug fix → Requires Level 2 refactor → Add plan.md to same folder

✅ **Feature enhancement** - Adding to existing functionality
- Example: "Add dark mode to modal" → Update modal-component spec

✅ **Resuming paused work** - Continuing previously paused implementation
- Example: Spec status: paused → active (add continuation notes)

### When to CREATE New Spec

Create a new spec folder when:

❌ **Distinct feature** - Completely separate functionality
- Example: "markdown-c7-optimizer" ≠ "markdown-validator" (different purposes)

❌ **Different approach** - Alternative implementation strategy
- Example: "hero-animation-css" vs "hero-animation-js" (different approaches)

❌ **Separate user story** - Different requirement or use case
- Example: "user-authentication" ≠ "user-profile" (separate stories)

❌ **Complete redesign** - Starting over with new architecture
- Example: "payment-flow-v2" (complete rewrite of v1)

❌ **Unrelated work** - No connection to existing specs
- Example: "add-search-feature" ≠ "fix-form-validation" (different areas)

### Decision Flowchart

```
User requests modification
    ↓
Extract keywords from request
    ↓
Search existing specs (folder names, titles)
    ↓
    ├─→ No matches found
    │      ↓
    │   Create new spec folder
    │
    └─→ Related specs found
           ↓
        Check status field
           ↓
           ├─→ status: active or draft
           │      ↓
           │   Recommend: UPDATE existing spec
           │   Reason: Work in progress, maintain continuity
           │
           ├─→ status: paused
           │      ↓
           │   ASK user: Resume paused work or create new?
           │   Reason: Context exists, but was stopped intentionally
           │
           └─→ status: complete or archived
                  ↓
               ASK user: Reopen completed work or create new?
               Reason: Feature was finished, ensure not regression
```

## 7. 📋 CROSS-CUTTING TEMPLATES (ANY LEVEL)

Some templates are not level-specific but can be used at any documentation level. These support session management, context preservation, and work summaries.

### Session Management Templates

| Template | Purpose | When to Use | Created By |
|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| `handover.md` | Session context transfer | End of work session requiring handoff | `/spec_kit:handover` command |
| `debug-delegation.md` | Debug task delegation | When stuck debugging (3+ failed attempts) | `/spec_kit:debug` command |

**Template Sources:**
- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/handover.md`
- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/debug-delegation.md`

### Summary Templates

| Template | Purpose | When to Use | Created By |
|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| `planning-summary.md` | High-level planning overview | After completing planning phase | Manual or after `/spec_kit:plan` |
| `implementation-summary.md` | Post-implementation documentation | After implementation complete | Manual or context save |

**Template Sources:**
- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/planning-summary.md`
- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/implementation-summary.md`

### Auto-Generated Context (Not Templates)

| Folder | Purpose | Creation Method |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `memory/` | Session context preservation | `generate-context.js` script via `/memory:save` |
| `scratch/` | Temporary workspace (disposable) | Manual creation (no template needed) |

**Important:**
- Memory files are auto-generated and should NOT be created manually
- Use `/memory:save` or `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/generate-context.js [spec-folder]`
- Scratch folder contents are temporary and should be cleaned up after work completes
