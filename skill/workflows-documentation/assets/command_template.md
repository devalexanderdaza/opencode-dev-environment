# Command Template - OpenCode Slash Commands

Templates and best practices for creating production-quality slash commands in OpenCode.

> **STYLE STANDARD:** Commands use numbered ALL-CAPS section headers WITHOUT decorative emojis. Format: `## N. SECTION-NAME`. Only SEMANTIC emojis (🚨 🔒 ✅ ❌ ⚠️) are allowed for blocking/warning patterns. See Section 14 Validation Checklist for details.

---

## 1. 📖 INTRODUCTION & PURPOSE

### What Are OpenCode Commands?

**OpenCode commands** are slash-triggered instructions (e.g., `/spec_kit:complete`, `/memory:save`) that automate workflows, enforce patterns, and extend AI agent capabilities. They're markdown files that define structured behavior for specific tasks.

**Core Purpose**:
- **Workflow automation** - Multi-step processes become single invocations
- **Pattern enforcement** - Consistent behavior across sessions
- **Task routing** - Arguments dispatch to appropriate handlers
- **User guidance** - Structured prompts prevent errors
- **Tool restriction** - Limit which tools the command can use

**Key Difference from Skills**:
- Commands = Actionable workflows triggered by `/command-name`
- Skills = Reference documentation loaded via `Read(".opencode/skill/<skill-name>/SKILL.md")`

### Core Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Markdown-based** | Human-readable instruction files |
| **Frontmatter-driven** | Metadata controls behavior (description, args, tools) |
| **Argument-aware** | Parse and validate user input via `$ARGUMENTS` |
| **Status-reporting** | Return structured outcomes (`STATUS=OK\|FAIL`) |
| **Tool-restricted** | `allowed-tools` limits available tools |

### How Commands Are Invoked

```
User types: /command-name arguments
                │           │
                │           └─► Passed as $ARGUMENTS variable
                │
                └─► OpenCode finds .opencode/command/command-name.md
                    │
                    ├─► Loads frontmatter (description, tools, hints)
                    │
                    ├─► Injects $ARGUMENTS into instruction body
                    │
                    └─► AI agent executes instructions step-by-step
```

### Command File Location

```
.opencode/
└── command/
    ├── simple-command.md          → /simple-command
    ├── workflow-command.md        → /workflow-command
    └── namespace/                  → Grouped commands
        ├── action1.md             → /namespace:action1
        └── action2.md             → /namespace:action2
```

### Progressive Complexity

```
Level 1: Simple Command
         └─ Single action, few arguments (~50-100 lines)
            ↓
Level 2: Workflow Command
         └─ Multi-step process with validation (~100-200 lines)
            ↓
Level 3: Mode-Based / Dispatch Command
         └─ Complex routing, user control (~150-300 lines)
```

## 2. 🎯 WHEN TO CREATE COMMANDS

### Create Command When

**Workflow Indicators**:
- Multi-step process with defined phases
- Repeated task needing consistency across sessions
- Requires confirmation gates (destructive actions)
- Multiple argument patterns need routing

**Control Requirements**:
- User should control execution pace (`:auto`/`:confirm` modes)
- Tool restrictions needed for security/focus
- Structured status reporting required

**Priority by Use Case**:

| Scenario | Priority | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Multi-step workflow | **High** | Single invocation for complex process |
| Repeated task | **High** | Consistency across sessions |
| Requires confirmation gates | **High** | Prevent accidental actions |
| Multiple argument patterns | **Medium** | Structured routing needed |
| Mode variants (auto/confirm) | **Medium** | User control over execution |
| Tool restrictions needed | **Medium** | Security/focus |

### Use Skill Instead When

**Reference Documentation Indicators**:
- Content is reference material, not executable workflow
- Complex domain knowledge that multiple commands might need
- Reusable patterns/standards across multiple commands

| Scenario | Better Choice | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Reference documentation | Skill (SKILL.md + references/) | Not an executable workflow |
| Complex domain knowledge | Skill with bundled resources | Reusable across contexts |
| Reusable across commands | Skill (commands invoke skills) | DRY principle |
| Standards/patterns library | Skill | Reference, not execution |

### Skip Command When

**Simplicity Indicators**:
- One-time task (just do it inline)
- Simple enough to explain in conversation
- No argument parsing needed
- No status reporting required

### Decision Framework

```
Is this a repeatable workflow with defined steps?
├─► YES
│   │
│   ├─► Does it need user arguments?
│   │   └─► Command with argument-hint + mandatory gate
│   │
│   ├─► Does it have modes (auto/confirm)?
│   │   └─► Mode-based command template
│   │
│   ├─► Is it destructive/irreversible?
│   │   └─► Destructive command template
│   │
│   ├─► Multiple action keywords (start/stop/status)?
│   │   └─► Argument dispatch pattern
│   │
│   └─► Simple single action?
│       └─► Simple command template
│
└─► NO
    │
    ├─► Is it reference documentation?
    │   └─► Create Skill instead
    │
    ├─► Is it reusable knowledge?
    │   └─► Create Skill instead
    │
    └─► Is it one-time task?
        └─► Just do it (no command needed)
```

### Command Types by Complexity

| Type | Complexity | Lines | Use When |
|------|------------|-------|----------|
| **Simple** | Low | 50-100 | Single action, few args |
| **Workflow** | Medium | 100-200 | Multi-step process with outputs |
| **Mode-Based** | Medium | 150-250 | User controls execution pace |
| **Argument Dispatch** | Medium | 150-300 | Multiple entry points/actions |
| **Destructive** | Medium | 100-180 | Irreversible actions, needs confirmation |
| **Namespace** | Varies | 50-150 each | Related commands grouped together |

## 6. 🚨 MANDATORY GATE PATTERN (CRITICAL)

### Why This Pattern Exists

Without this gate, AI agents may:
- Infer tasks from conversation history or open files
- Assume what the user wants based on screenshots or context
- Proceed with incorrect assumptions instead of asking

### When to Use

| Argument Type | Use Mandatory Gate? | Example |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| `<required>` (angle brackets) | **YES** | `<task>`, `<query>`, `<spec-folder>` |
| `[optional]` (square brackets) | No (has default) | `[count]`, `[--flag]` |
| `[:auto\|:confirm]` mode flags | No (mode selection) | Mode suffixes only |

### The Pattern

Add this block **immediately after frontmatter, before any other content**:

```markdown
# 🚨 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION - DO NOT SKIP

**BEFORE READING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS FILE, CHECK `$ARGUMENTS`:**

\`\`\`
IF $ARGUMENTS is empty, undefined, or contains only whitespace (ignoring mode flags):
    → STOP IMMEDIATELY
    → Present the user with this question:
        question: "[Context-appropriate question]"
        options:
          - label: "[Action label]"
            description: "[What user will provide]"
    → WAIT for user response
    → Use their response as the [input type]
    → Only THEN continue with this workflow

IF $ARGUMENTS contains [expected input]:
    → Continue reading this file
\`\`\`

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **DO NOT** infer [input type] from context, screenshots, or existing files
- **DO NOT** assume what the user wants based on conversation history
- **DO NOT** proceed past this point without an explicit [input] from the user
- The [input] MUST come from `$ARGUMENTS` or user's answer to the question above
```

### Example Questions by Command Type

| Command Purpose | Question |
|-----------------|----------|
| Planning | "What would you like to plan?" |
| Research | "What topic would you like to research?" |
| Implementation | "Which spec folder would you like to implement?" |
| File improvement | "What would you like to improve and which files?" |
| Prompt enhancement | "What prompt would you like to improve?" |
| Generic routing | "What request would you like to route?" |

---

## 7. 🔀 MODE DETECTION PATTERN

### Overview

Mode-based commands support `:auto` and `:confirm` execution modes, giving users control over approval gates.

### Mode Definitions

| Pattern | Mode | Behavior |
|---------|------|----------|
| `/command:auto` | AUTONOMOUS | Execute all steps without user approval gates |
| `/command:confirm` | INTERACTIVE | Pause at each step for user approval |
| `/command` (no suffix) | PROMPT | Ask user to choose mode |

### Mode Selection Logic

```markdown
## MODE DETECTION & ROUTING

### Step 1: Parse Mode Suffix

Detect execution mode from command invocation:

| Pattern | Mode | Behavior |
|---------|------|----------|
| `/command:auto` | AUTONOMOUS | Execute all steps without user approval gates |
| `/command:confirm` | INTERACTIVE | Pause at each step for user approval |
| `/command` (no suffix) | PROMPT | Ask user to choose mode |

### Step 2: Mode Selection (when no suffix detected)

If no `:auto` or `:confirm` suffix is present, present options to user:

**Question**: "How would you like to execute this workflow?"

| Option | Mode | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **A** | Autonomous | Execute all steps without approval gates |
| **B** | Interactive | Pause at each step for approval |

**Wait for user response before proceeding.**
```

### Key Behaviors by Mode

**Autonomous Mode (`:auto`):**
- Executes all steps without user approval gates
- Self-validates at each checkpoint
- Makes informed decisions based on best judgment
- Documents all significant decisions

**Interactive Mode (`:confirm`):**
- Pauses after each step for user approval
- Presents options: Approve, Review Details, Modify, Skip, Abort
- Documents user decisions at each checkpoint
- Allows course correction throughout workflow

## 8. 📄 SIMPLE COMMAND TEMPLATE

Use for: Single-action commands with straightforward execution.

```markdown
---

---

# 🚨 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION - DO NOT SKIP

**BEFORE READING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS FILE, CHECK `$ARGUMENTS`:**

\`\`\`
IF $ARGUMENTS is empty, undefined, or contains only whitespace:
    → STOP IMMEDIATELY
    → Present options to user
    → WAIT for user response
    → Only THEN continue

IF $ARGUMENTS contains required input:
    → Continue reading this file
\`\`\`

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **DO NOT** infer from context, screenshots, or conversation history
- **DO NOT** assume what the user wants
- **DO NOT** proceed without explicit input from the user

**Purpose**: [Description of what this command accomplishes.]

---

## 1. 📋 USER INPUT

\`\`\`text
$ARGUMENTS
\`\`\`

---

## 2. 🔍 MODE DETECTION & ROUTING

### Step 1: Parse Mode Suffix

Detect execution mode from command invocation:

| Pattern | Mode | Behavior |
|---------|------|----------|
| `/command:auto` | AUTONOMOUS | Execute all steps without user approval gates |
| `/command:confirm` | INTERACTIVE | Pause at each step for user approval |
| `/command` (no suffix) | PROMPT | Ask user to choose mode |

### Step 2: Mode Selection (when no suffix detected)

If no `:auto` or `:confirm` suffix is present, present options to user:

**Question**: "How would you like to execute this workflow?"

| Option | Mode | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **A** | Autonomous | Execute all steps without approval gates. Best for [use case]. |
| **B** | Interactive | Pause at each step for approval. Best for [use case]. |

**Wait for user response before proceeding.**

### Step 3: Transform Raw Input

Parse the raw text from `$ARGUMENTS` and transform into structured fields.

---

## 3. ⚡ KEY BEHAVIORS

### Autonomous Mode (`:auto`)
- Executes all steps without user approval gates
- Self-validates at each checkpoint
- Makes informed decisions based on best judgment
- Documents all significant decisions

### Interactive Mode (`:confirm`)
- Pauses after each step for user approval
- Presents options: Approve, Review Details, Modify, Skip, Abort
- Documents user decisions at each checkpoint
- Allows course correction throughout workflow

---

## 4. 📁 CONTEXT LOADING

When resuming work in an existing spec folder, prompt to load prior session memory:
- **A)** Load most recent memory file (quick context refresh)
- **B)** Load all recent files (up to 3) (comprehensive context)
- **C)** List all files and select specific (historical search)
- **D)** Skip (start fresh, no context)

---

## 5. 🎯 EXAMPLES

**Example 1: Autonomous execution**
\`\`\`
/command:auto [arguments]
\`\`\`

**Example 2: Interactive execution**
\`\`\`
/command:confirm [arguments]
\`\`\`

**Example 3: Prompt for mode selection**
\`\`\`
/command [arguments]
\`\`\`
```

---

## 11. 🧭 ARGUMENT DISPATCH PATTERN

Use for: Commands that accept multiple argument types and need to route to different actions.

### Pattern Overview

When a single command handles multiple argument patterns (like `/semantic_search` accepting queries, actions, and flags), use an ASCII decision tree to document the routing logic clearly.

### When to Use Argument Dispatch

| Scenario | Use Pattern? |
|----------|--------------|
| Command has multiple action keywords | **Yes** |
| Command accepts both keywords AND queries | **Yes** |
| Command has only one action | No (use simple template) |
| Command uses `:auto`/`:confirm` modes only | No (use mode-based template) |

### The Pattern

```markdown
---
description: [Command] with multiple entry points
argument-hint: "[action|query] [options]"
allowed-tools: [Tools]
---

# [Command Title]

---

## 1. 📋 ARGUMENT DISPATCH

\`\`\`
$ARGUMENTS
    │
    ├─► Empty (no args)
    │   └─► DEFAULT ACTION: [What happens with no args]
    │
    ├─► First word matches ACTION KEYWORD (case-insensitive)
    │   ├─► "start" | "on" | "init"       → START ACTION
    │   ├─► "stop" | "off" | "kill"       → STOP ACTION
    │   ├─► "status" | "info"             → STATUS ACTION
    │   ├─► "search" | "find" | "query"   → SEARCH ACTION (remaining args = query)
    │   └─► "reset" | "clear"             → RESET ACTION
    │
    ├─► Looks like NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY
    │   Detection: 2+ words, question words, code terms, quotes
    │   └─► SEARCH ACTION (full args = query)
    │
    └─► Single ambiguous word
        └─► [DEFAULT ACTION] (assume most common intent)
\`\`\`

---

## 2. ⚡ ACTION HANDLERS

### START ACTION
[Instructions for start]

### STOP ACTION
[Instructions for stop]

### SEARCH ACTION
[Instructions for search]

---

## 3. 📊 EXAMPLE ROUTING

| Input | Detected As | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| (empty) | No args | Show menu/help |
| `start` | Keyword | START ACTION |
| `how does auth work` | Natural language | SEARCH ACTION |
| `oauth` | Single word | SEARCH ACTION (default) |
```

### Real Example: `/semantic_search`

```
/semantic_search [args]
    │
    ├─► No args
    │   └─► Show usage help
    │
    ├─► "index" | "reindex" | "rebuild"
    │   └─► INDEX ACTION: Rebuild vector index
    │
    ├─► "status" | "health"
    │   └─► STATUS ACTION: Show index health
    │
    ├─► Natural language query (2+ words)
    │   └─► SEARCH ACTION: Execute semantic search
    │
    └─► Single ambiguous word
        └─► SEARCH ACTION (assume search intent)
```

### Combining with Mode-Based Pattern

For commands that need BOTH argument dispatch AND mode support:

```
$ARGUMENTS
    │
    ├─► Parse mode suffix (:auto | :confirm)
    │
    └─► After mode extraction, dispatch remaining args:
        ├─► "action1" → ACTION 1
        ├─► "action2" → ACTION 2
        └─► Natural language → DEFAULT ACTION
```

---

## 12. ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE COMMAND TEMPLATE

Use for: Commands that delete data or make irreversible changes.

```markdown
---
description: [Action] (DESTRUCTIVE)
argument-hint: "[--confirm]"
allowed-tools: Bash
---

# [Command Title]

**DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION** - [Brief warning about what will be affected.]

---

## 1. 📋 PURPOSE

[Explain the destructive action and why it might be needed.]

---

## 2. 📝 CONTRACT

**Inputs:** `$ARGUMENTS` — Must include `--confirm` flag to skip prompt
**Outputs:** `STATUS=<OK|FAIL|CANCELLED> ACTION=<action|cancelled>`

---

## 3. ⚡ INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Safety Check - Require Confirmation

- Check if `--confirm` flag is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- If NOT present:
  - Ask user: "[Warning message]. Are you sure?"
  - Options: "Yes, proceed" / "No, cancel"
  - If user cancels: `STATUS=CANCELLED ACTION=cancelled`

### Step 2: Show What Will Be Affected

- Display current state
- List items that will be deleted/changed
- Show size/count of affected data

### Step 3: Execute Destructive Action

- [Step-by-step execution]
- Log each action taken

### Step 4: Verify Completion

- Confirm action completed
- Show new state

### Step 5: Provide Recovery Guidance

- Explain how to rebuild/restore if needed
- Link to relevant commands

### Step 6: Return Status

- If completed: `STATUS=OK ACTION=[action]`
- If cancelled: `STATUS=CANCELLED ACTION=cancelled`
- If failed: `STATUS=FAIL ERROR="<message>"`

---

## 4. 🔍 EXAMPLE USAGE

### Without Confirmation (Safe Default)

\`\`\`bash
/command-name
\`\`\`
→ Will prompt for confirmation before proceeding

### With Confirmation Flag (Skip Prompt)

\`\`\`bash
/command-name --confirm
\`\`\`
→ Proceeds immediately (use with caution)

- Requires explicit confirmation by default
- Shows what will be affected before proceeding
- Provides clear recovery steps
- Cannot accidentally affect [protected items]
```

---

## 13. 📁 NAMESPACE COMMAND PATTERN

Use for: Grouping related commands under a common prefix.

### Directory Structure

```
.opencode/command/
└── [namespace]/           # Directory name = namespace
    ├── [action1].md       # → /namespace:action1
    ├── [action2].md       # → /namespace:action2
    └── [action3].md       # → /namespace:action3
```

### Example: Index Namespace

```
.opencode/command/
└── index/
    ├── start.md     → /index:start
    ├── stop.md      → /index:stop
    ├── search.md    → /index:search
    ├── stats.md     → /index:stats
    ├── history.md   → /index:history
    └── reset.md     → /index:reset
```

### Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Namespace directory | lowercase, hyphen-case | `index/`, `git-workflow/` |
| Action files | lowercase, hyphen-case | `search.md`, `full-reset.md` |
| Resulting command | namespace:action | `/index:search` |

## 14. ✅ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before publishing a command, verify:

### Frontmatter

- [ ] `description` is present and action-oriented
- [ ] `argument-hint` shows expected format (if args expected)
- [ ] `allowed-tools` lists all tools used (if any)
- [ ] No angle brackets `< >` in description (reserved for hints)

### Mandatory Gate (CRITICAL for required arguments)

- [ ] If `argument-hint` contains `<required>` args → **MANDATORY GATE present**
- [ ] Gate is **immediately after frontmatter**, before any other content
- [ ] Gate presents options to user with appropriate question
- [ ] Gate includes all 4 CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT infer, assume, proceed)
- [ ] Skip gate only if ALL arguments are `[optional]` with defaults

### Structure

- [ ] H1 title matches command purpose (no emoji, no number)
- [ ] H2 sections use format: `## N. SECTION-NAME` (no decorative emoji)
- [ ] H3 subsections: `### Step N: Description` (no emoji)
- [ ] Dividers (`---`) between major sections
- [ ] Instructions are numbered and actionable
- [ ] Example usage shows 2-3 scenarios

### Header Format

- [ ] H1: Plain title only (`# Command Title`)
- [ ] H2: Numbered + ALL-CAPS, no decorative emoji (`## 1. PURPOSE`)
- [ ] H3/H4: Title case, no emoji (`### Step 1: Description`)
- [ ] Consistent numbering (1, 2, 3...)
- [ ] Semantic emojis only where needed (blocking gates, validation states)

**Exception - Blocking Phase Pattern:**
Commands with mandatory input phases may use semantic emojis:
- `# 🚨 MANDATORY PHASES` - Critical blocking section
- `## 🔒 PHASE N:` - Required blocking phases
- `## ✅ PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION` - Gate checks

---

## 15. EMOJI POLICY FOR COMMANDS

Commands prioritize **clarity over decoration**. Only SEMANTIC emojis are allowed.

### Allowed Semantic Emojis

| Emoji | Meaning | Use In |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 🚨 | Critical/Blocking | Mandatory gates, critical warnings |
| 🔒 | Locked/Required | Required phases, blocking steps |
| ✅ | Pass/Success | Validation results, completion |
| ❌ | Fail/Error | Validation failures |
| ⚠️ | Warning/Caution | Conditional warnings |

### NOT Allowed (Decorative)

Decorative emojis like 📋 📖 🎯 ⚡ 📝 🔍 📊 🏷️ 🔀 🧭 📁 🔧 🛡️ 🔗 🧠 are **NOT used** in command H2 headers.

### Rationale

Per `core_standards.md`, commands should NEVER use decorative emojis. Semantic emojis convey critical information (blocking status, validation state) that affects execution flow.

---

## 16. BLOCKING PHASE PATTERN

For commands with mandatory input collection phases, use this structure to enforce blocking gates before workflow execution.

### When to Use

| Scenario | Use Blocking Phase Pattern? |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Command requires user input before ANY workflow steps | **Yes** |
| Multiple inputs must be collected and validated | **Yes** |
| Single optional input with defaults | No (use simple mandatory gate) |
| No required inputs | No |

### Pattern Structure

```markdown
# 🚨 MANDATORY PHASES - BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT

> **HARD BLOCK**: Do not proceed past this section until ALL phases complete.

## 🔒 PHASE 1: INPUT COLLECTION

**Required Inputs:**
- Input A: [description]
- Input B: [description]

**Collection Method:**
1. Check `$ARGUMENTS` for provided values
2. If missing, prompt user with structured options
3. Validate format/type before proceeding

## 🔒 PHASE 2: CONTEXT VERIFICATION

**Verify:**
- [ ] Required files exist
- [ ] Permissions are sufficient
- [ ] No conflicting state

## ✅ PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION (BLOCKING)

Before proceeding to workflow:

| Phase | Status | Blocker? |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Input Collection | ✅/❌ | HARD |
| Context Verification | ✅/❌ | HARD |

**Gate Check:**
- ALL phases must show ✅
- ANY ❌ = STOP and resolve before continuing

---

## 1. PURPOSE

[Standard workflow sections begin here...]
```

### Key Elements

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `# 🚨 MANDATORY PHASES` | H1 with semantic emoji signals critical blocking section |
| `## 🔒 PHASE N:` | Each required phase uses lock emoji |
| `## ✅ PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION` | Gate check before proceeding |
| `---` separator | Visual break between blocking phases and workflow |
| Standard sections follow | `## 1. PURPOSE`, `## 2. CONTRACT`, etc. (no decorative emoji) |

### Example: Spec Creation Command

```markdown
# 🚨 MANDATORY PHASES - BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT

## 🔒 PHASE 1: TASK IDENTIFICATION

Check `$ARGUMENTS`:
- If empty → Ask: "What would you like to work on?"
- If provided → Parse and validate task description

## 🔒 PHASE 2: SPEC FOLDER SELECTION

Present options:
- A) Use existing spec folder
- B) Create new spec folder
- C) Skip documentation (not recommended)

## ✅ PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION (BLOCKING)

| Phase | Required |
|-------|----------|
| Task identified | ✅ Must have explicit task |
| Folder selected | ✅ Must have A/B/C response |

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Create structured documentation for development tasks...
```

## 17. ORCHESTRATOR + WORKERS PATTERN

Use for: Commands that spawn parallel sub-agents for exploration/analysis.

### Pattern Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OPUS ORCHESTRATOR                                          │
│  - Understands task                                         │
│  - Dispatches Sonnet workers                                │
│  - Verifies hypotheses                                      │
│  - Synthesizes findings                                     │
│  - Creates final output                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              │
              ├──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
              ▼                  ▼                  ▼
┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│ SONNET WORKER 1 │  │ SONNET WORKER 2 │  │ SONNET WORKER N │
│ Fast exploration│  │ Fast exploration│  │ Fast exploration│
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
```

### Model Hierarchy

| Role | Model | Responsibility |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Orchestrator** | `opus` | Task understanding, dispatch, verification, synthesis |
| **Workers** | `sonnet` | Fast parallel exploration, discovery, hypothesis generation |

### When to Use

| Scenario | Use Orchestrator Pattern? |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Parallel codebase exploration | Yes |
| Multi-aspect analysis | Yes |
| Complex planning with verification | Yes |
| Simple single-action command | No |
| Sequential workflow | No |

---

## 18. STATUS OUTPUT PATTERNS

### Standard Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `STATUS=OK` | Simple success | Basic commands |
| `STATUS=OK RESULTS_COUNT=N` | Search/query | `/index:search` |
| `STATUS=OK ACTION=<action>` | State change | `/index:start` |
| `STATUS=OK ACTION=<action> PATH=<path>` | File creation | `/spec_kit:complete` |
| `STATUS=FAIL ERROR="<message>"` | All failures | Error handling |
| `STATUS=CANCELLED ACTION=cancelled` | User abort | Interactive commands |

---

## 19. BEST PRACTICES SUMMARY

### DO

| Practice | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Include mandatory gate for required args | Prevents context inference errors |
| Use action verbs in descriptions | Clear, scannable in /help |
| Document all steps with checkpoints | Enables debugging and recovery |
| Provide example usage | Users learn faster |
| Return structured status | Enables automation |
| Use appropriate command type | Right tool for the job |

### DON'T
